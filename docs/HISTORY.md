<!-- chapter v1 -->
## v1
Source: docs/v1/ at bd0c224688d9. 53 phases.
The v1 notes folder is history, not documentation of the app as it exists today; phase notes are kept as originally written, not edited to track later changes.
Result sets are stored columnar: one array per column plus a shared row count.
A hand-edited or stale-shape row fails loudly instead of propagating undefineds into the UI.
The SQL console is gated on the connection's caps.sql rather than shown unconditionally.
A document body past 64 KB falls back to its raw text rather than a tree, with a truncated badge.
Committing an edit in the editable grid stages a pending cell edit (§8.14) rather than writing immediately.
DocumentTree.vue was moved to views/shared/document/ so both places can mount it.
A folder with no children shows "No items" rather than an empty list indistinguishable from a still-loading one.
A lint override now enforces §11's layering rule at lint time instead of by review alone.
ClickHouse's testcontainers module hardcodes a ulimit override the sandbox cannot satisfy, so the subclass NoUlimitClickHouseContainer in tests/ipc/clickhouse/container.ts clears hostConfig.Ulimits in its constructor.
The ClickHouse backend fixture freezes one non-determinism per D6: a materialized view's auto-generated .inner_id.<uuid> backing-table name, a fresh random UUID per container.
tests/db/ holds exhaustive adapter-edge coverage, while the backend half of tests/ipc/ is one linear fixture-capturing scenario per adapter; the tiers test different layers, so similar assertions are not duplicates.
redis's truncated field is undefined at the adapter level and false at the IPC level, because tree-service.ts normalizes what the adapter omits.
Building @confluentinc/kafka-javascript always tries to vendor-build zlib/libcurl/libcrypto/zstd from source; setting the CKJS_LINKING environment variable to dynamic skips this and links against system dev packages.
The Kafka backend test drives the real tree with topics ungrouped, each consumer group as its own root-level node, and "Consumer groups" as a frontend-only folder over it.
A Kafka read fans across both partitions and interleaves them by arrival rather than key or offset order, so the fixture is sorted by key before writing.
The Kafka consumer group's coordinator host:port is non-deterministic (fresh Docker hostname and host-mapped port each run) and is frozen per D6.
The Wails spike phase requires the user's explicit sign-off before any implementation begins; the word "spike" does not exempt it from CLAUDE.md's Opus-plans-then-sign-off-then-implement loop.
Most Wails claims in the plan are best-current-knowledge for a spike stage to confirm, because wails.io and v3.wails.io are blocked by the environment's egress proxy and the official docs were never read.
Wails has no first-class sidecar/external-binary mechanism, so spawning the Node child and bundling the vendored runtime are both hand-rolled.
Wails v3's default binding transport is a fetch() to a local /wails/runtime endpoint with a JSON.stringify body, a full JSON round-trip; the runtime source also exposes a setTransport() override worth investigating for bulk data.
No first-party WebDriver story for Wails surfaced; discussion #4205 recommends pointing Playwright at wails dev's localhost:34115, which is not shell-integration coverage.
The E2E decision carries over unchanged from the deleted Tauri plan: the UI suite moves fully to Playwright's isolated webkit tier, permanently giving up native menu/window/lifecycle coverage, real-IPC-bridge correctness, real Keychain coverage and src/main/security.ts's navigation-lock posture.
In the Wails architecture, settings, tabs, layout and op log live in the Go process, so losing the engine means "reconnect your databases" (engine-host.ts's no-auto-respawn policy) rather than the app being unable to save anything.
In the Wails architecture Keychain access becomes ordinary in-process Go code, with no privileged cross-process surface, resolving the credential seam rather than relocating it.
Wails being a smaller, less mature project than Tauri is an accepted trade-off given the user's explicit Go-over-Rust preference; the spike does not relitigate it.
The Wails spike row supersedes the former "P51 Tauri + Node sidecar migration spike"; P20's own row and its out-of-scope verdict are unchanged.

### v1 P0 Foundations
v1 P0 foundations use Bun, Biome, TS7 and electron-vite as the toolchain.
v1 P0 includes a three-process skeleton that communicates via MessagePort.
v1 P0 includes SQLite storage with migrations.
v1 P0 includes dark theme tokens and codicons.
v1 P0 workbench shell includes panels, status bar toggles, and a settings dialog with fonts.
v1 P0 includes a Playwright harness that launches and screenshots the app.
All other v1 work builds on the P0 foundations.

### v1 P1 Connections & tree
v1 P1 (Connections & tree) covers connection CRUD (fields + URI), colors, adapter interface, PostgreSQL adapter, connect/disconnect, lazy cached tree, green dot, tree context menus, filters + panel search, operations panel, L1 metadata cache, and a Testcontainers harness for Postgres.
v1 P1 is the first end-to-end vertical slice; it proves the adapter shape before five more adapters are written.

### v1 P2 Tabular data view
v1 P2 tabular data view scope: virtualized grid, tabs (same table opened N times), pagination with page sizes, count-all, projection, sort, stop button, search toolbar, L2/L3 caches and prefetch.
v1 P2 filter toolbar covers WHERE and ORDER BY input plus history and saved filters.
v1 P2 adds a MariaDB adapter as a second SQL engine, because it cheaply validates the database abstraction.

### v1 P3 Cell editor
The v1 P3 deliverable is a cell editor: a CodeMirror panel with format autodetect, manual format override, and beautify (indented or compact). It depends on grid selection.

### v1 P4 DDL tabs
In v1 P4, the DDL tabs are a read-only DDL view built on a model that is ready to become editable.

### v1 P5 Mutations
v1 P5 (Mutations) covers add/delete row, cell editing, pending-change set, exact-command preview, commit/rollback, read-only guard, and cache invalidation.
v1 P5 (Mutations) depends on the grid, cell editor, preview, and op log.

### v1 P5.5 Query console
Phase v1 P5.5 is the query console: a console tab that runs a statement or all statements, shows results in the grid, and supports saved queries.
Phase v1 P5.5 (query console) needs the grid and the op log, and is independent of the remaining adapters.

### v1 P6 Interaction completeness
Phase v1 P6 is 'Interaction completeness': the full right-click matrix, copy/paste rows, and keyboard shortcuts.

### v1 P7 PK/FK navigation
Phase v1 P7 covers PK/FK navigation: an FK metadata graph, cell buttons, and filtered tabs.

### v1 P8 MongoDB
v1 P8 delivers a MongoDB adapter and a document view with expand/collapse, edit and delete.
MongoDB is the first non-tabular shape; v1 P8 validates the page-kind union.

### v1 P9 Redis
Phase v1 P9 covers Redis via an adapter plus a key/value view, as the second non-tabular shape.

### v1 P10 Kafka + SQS
v1 plan phase P10 covers Kafka and SQS adapters plus a stream view.
Kafka and SQS (v1 P10) have the most divergent semantics and benefit from everything in the earlier phases.

### v1 P11 Pre-connect scripts
Pre-connect scripts are a per-connection optional shell command (e.g. port-forward) that runs before connecting.
A connection is marked disconnected if its pre-connect script process exits while the connection is in use.
Pre-connect scripts are configured in the connection dialog UI.
Pre-connect scripts cut across every adapter, so they land once the adapter surface is complete, ahead of the final hardening pass.

### v1 P12 Hardening
Phase v1 P12 (Hardening) covers a memory/perf pass against the §2 budgets, cache tuning, cold-start time, and unsigned packaging.
Measure performance only once the surface is complete, because nothing should still be changing under it.

### v1 P13 Nonfunctional checks
Phase P13 (v1) is the nonfunctional-checks phase: sweep the whole codebase for memory leaks, storage leaks, inefficient or redundant DB interaction, and insufficient caching, and fix everything found.
P12 measured against budgets and only pulled the levers its numbers justified, deliberately leaving several items open for a dedicated sweep, listed in docs/PERF.md §4. P13 closes them before the surface is described in docs.

### v1 P14 Docs
The v1 P14 docs phase covers descriptions in every expected in-repo location plus the main repository README, including full functionality, install and dev-setup instructions.
Docs are written once the app's behavior and nonfunctional characteristics are final, so nothing documented needs revisiting.

### v1 P15 GH tooling
The GH tooling phase (P15) covers a pre-commit hook, GitHub Actions CI that runs on macOS only, a tag-triggered unsigned macOS binary build, and verified auto-update configuration.
The GH tooling phase (P15) is scheduled last, because CI and release tooling should target a finished, documented build rather than a moving one.

### v1 P16 Misc fixes
P16 adds an explicit per-connection preconnect-mode checkbox that overrides P11's settle-window auto-detection.
P16 adds a connection-kind icon picker and a click-to-open connection-error popover.
P16 gives scripts/demo-dbs/ full six-engine coverage.
P16 fixes two font-family bugs and adds testcontainers preset packages for Postgres, MariaDB and Redis.
P16 is not a planned deliverable. It is a batch of user-directed fixes found after P15 shipped, grouped into one phase rather than reopening P1, P9, P10, P11 and P14.

### v1 P17 S3
The S3 adapter's object browser tree mirrors redis's namespace-tree shape, using '/' as delimiter instead of ':' and bucket/prefix/object node kinds instead of database/namespace/key.
An S3 object reuses the keyvalue page kind: its metadata (ContentType, Size, LastModified, ETag, StorageClass, user Metadata) plus a Body field/value row matches the flat listing a redis hash key renders, so KeyValueView.vue needed no new view.
S3 support is read-only browsing in this phase, with no insert, update or delete of buckets or objects.
tests/db/s3.spec.ts tests the S3 adapter against a LocalStack container, mirroring the structure of sqs.spec.ts.

### v1 P18 Autocomplete
Autocomplete is scoped to the four surfaces with a real free-text identifier grammar (SQL's WHERE/ORDER BY, Mongo's filter/SORT) plus the query console.
Redis, Kafka, SQS and S3 get no autocomplete, because they have no free-text identifier surface (local-page search, a structured multiselect, or nothing), per docs/plans/P18-autocomplete.md's D1.
AutocompleteField.vue owns its own input rather than wrapping TextField.vue, because a wrapper can't safely intercept Enter across two components (see plan §1).
SQL column completions are inserted dialect-quoted only when quoting is needed.
Mongo field completions insert as 'field: ', include _id, and use a curated $-operator vocabulary.
The shared CodeMirror host has undo/redo restored via history()/historyKeymap, folded into the existing read-only compartment.
The console completion popup has no typing debounce (activateOnTypingDelay/interactionDelay: 0), and Tab, not Enter, accepts a completion so Enter stays a newline in the multi-line console.
In the query console, SQL keywords, types and builtins complete in uppercase via sql()'s upperCaseKeywords.
Mongo console completion offers collection names after db., the ten supported shell methods after db.<collection>., and $-operators.
Redis console completion offers command names on the first token only.
The Mongo and Redis consoles each have their own StreamLanguage highlighting mode instead of SQL's.
Inline lexical/shape-level diagnostics per engine come from a lintSource prop/compartment using @codemirror/lint, with no gutter or panel, only an underline and a themed hover tooltip.
Diagnostics reuse each adapter's own error wording so a diagnostic can never contradict what running the statement would do.

### v1 P19 Tree reorganization + generic object-definition view
The tree shows tables first, ungrouped; every other object kind (functions, sequences, etc.) is grouped into per-kind folders by default.
Tables no longer expand to show columns in the tree; columns are shown in the definition view instead.
A renderer-only GROUPED_KINDS table (view/matview/sequence/function, with MariaDB's function folder labelled "Routines") splits an already-fetched child list into ungrouped tables/collections plus collapsed per-kind folders; expanding a folder issues no IPC call and no op-log row.
Tables, views, matviews and collections are tree leaves; both SQL adapters' children() return [] at that depth, and the DB specs' column assertions moved to describe().
The DDL feature was renamed to "definition" end to end (Caps.ddl→Caps.definition, adapter method, IPC channel, tab kind, L1 cache key, views/ddl/→views/definition/) to fit non-SQL connections.
A legacy 'ddl'-row coercion on read means upgrading doesn't drop open tabs or blank the Operations panel.
ObjectDefinition gained language, constraints and documentSchema fields.
Postgres fills ObjectDefinition constraints from the pg_constraint query it already runs for its DDL text, with zero extra round trips.
MariaDB fills constraints from one added information_schema.TABLE_CONSTRAINTS query, run on the definition path only.
The definition tab is one view with a Structure/Source Segmented toggle (not the mockup's four-way split); Structure is the default and Source shows raw SQL text.
Structure stacks Columns/Indexes/Constraints sections for SQL, or Indexes/Validation for Mongo, with count badges, fed by a second, independently-cached describe() load.
The tree's former column-row context menu (Copy name/Add to projection/Sort by) was relocated into the definition view's Columns section.
Mongo's definition() sources Source from the collection's creation-options document (EJSON-relaxed) and Validation from its $jsonSchema validator, rendered as a field table when it is one, else raw JSON, with an empty state when there is none.
The P19 implementation plan is in docs/plans/P19-tree-reorg-definition-view.md.

### v1 P20 Electrobun migration spike
The Electrobun migration spike (P20) is out of scope and will not be done; it was superseded by a direct Electron memory-footprint pass (see docs/PERF.md).
Electrobun has no E2E testing path: its webview is WKWebView, which Apple exposes no WebDriver/CDP endpoint for, so _electron.launch() in tests/ui/*.spec.ts has no equivalent and Cypress hits the same wall.
The only working Electrobun E2E alternative, Appium mac2-driver/XCUITest, drives the OS accessibility tree rather than the DOM, so for this app's grid-heavy cell-level UI it would mean rewriting the whole suite's interaction model with no CSS-selector equivalent.
Electrobun's RPC bridge only copies payloads and has no port-transfer primitive (no Transferable/ArrayBuffer/structuredClone in rpc.ts), so it cannot support SPEC §4's MessageChannelMain design where the engine subprocess gets a port straight into the renderer.
Under Electrobun, bulk pages would move onto the same event loop as the native menu and window chrome, undermining the interaction budgets in docs/PERF.md §2.1 rather than merely needing re-measurement.
Electrobun is pre-1.0 (its default JSC-based main-process runtime, Cottontail, is v0.5.0), so API compatibility under either mainProcess option is unverified beyond docs.
Electrobun's benefit (lower baseline memory/idle footprint) was judged not to clear the cost given the E2E and bulk-data dealbreakers.
Run each branch's perf tests (budgets, perf, memory, startup specs under tests/ui) multiple times, because they have real run-to-run variability and a single sample can't show a real difference (docs/PERF.md §2.1).
Get the user's explicit sign-off before implementing any spike phase, including the Wails migration spike, because the word "spike" does not exempt it from CLAUDE.md's Opus-plans-then-sign-off-then-implement loop.
Wails has no first-class sidecar/external-binary mechanism, so spawning the Node child and bundling the vendored runtime are both hand-rolled (discussion #3021 was answered only with go:embed).
Wails v3's default binding transport is a fetch() to a local /wails/runtime endpoint with a JSON.stringify body (a full JSON round-trip), though a setTransport() override exists worth investigating for bulk data.
No first-party WebDriver story exists for Wails; discussion #4205 suggests pointing Playwright at wails dev's localhost:34115, which is not shell-integration coverage.
In the Wails plan the UI suite moves fully to Playwright's isolated webkit tier, permanently giving up native menu/window/lifecycle coverage, real-IPC-bridge correctness, real Keychain coverage and src/main/security.ts's navigation-lock posture.
In the Wails architecture, settings/tabs/layout/op log live in the Go process, so losing the engine means reconnecting databases (engine-host.ts's no-auto-respawn policy) rather than the app being unable to save.
In the Wails architecture Keychain access becomes ordinary in-process Go code, with no privileged cross-process surface.
Wails being smaller and less mature than Tauri is an accepted trade-off given the user's explicit Go-over-Rust preference, and the spike does not relitigate it.
The Wails plan row supersedes the former "P51 Tauri + Node sidecar migration spike"; P20's own row and out-of-scope verdict are unchanged.

### v1 P21 Menu shortcut hints
Every context-menu item that has a keyboard shortcut prints it alongside its label, VS Code style, muted and right-aligned.
A single shared binding table (src/shared/shortcuts.ts) is the one source of truth, feeding the native menu bar's accelerators, the context menus' displayed keys, and the local DOM-scoped keydown handlers, so a printed key and the key that runs cannot drift.
The P21 audit covered all 104 context-menu rows across 21 builders and surfaced 5 bindings that already worked but were never shown: the grid's Cmd/Ctrl+C over cell/row/column selections, its Enter-to-edit, and the tab strip's Cmd/Ctrl+W.
P21 adds 9 new bindings following VS Code conventions: F2 rename, Delete/⌘⌫ delete, Ctrl/Cmd+C copy, Ctrl/Cmd+N new, Enter open, Shift+Alt+C copy path, and Ctrl/Cmd+D duplicate.
The new P21 shortcuts are scoped only to the project tree and the SQL grid, the two surfaces that already have focus and a selection.
The P21 audit could be exhaustive because the right-click matrix (P6) and every view that feeds it are complete; the binding table must exist before shortcuts can be shown or remapped.
The P21 plan is documented at docs/plans/P21-menu-shortcut-hints.md.

### v1 P22 App-owned tooltips
The app draws all hover hints itself: the native title attribute is removed from src/renderer and replaced by a v-tooltip directive plus one AppTooltip.vue singleton mounted beside ContextMenu.vue.
AppTooltip.vue shares the same Teleport/fixed/.p-float chrome as every other floating surface in the app.
The tooltip opens after 400 ms (the app's existing hover constant, the lint delay in CodeMirrorHost.vue) and re-arms without the pause when moving between adjacent controls.
The tooltip hides on leave, click, key, scroll and blur, and is pointer-events: none so it can never intercept the press it describes.
The hovered control is resolved via one document-level rAF-coalesced pointermove plus elementFromPoint, not per-element mouseenter, because Blink dispatches no pointer events on a disabled control and many hints explain a disabled state.
The v-tooltip directive mirrors the hint into aria-label where the control has no accessible name, and wires aria-describedby while shown; focusin opens the tooltip for keyboard users.
main.ts registers v-tooltip globally, and App.vue installs and tears down the single document-level listener set.
The tooltip text is exposed in the data-kira-tip attribute, and UI tests read it from there instead of from title.
The remaining title= occurrences in the tree are component props (DialogFrame's and SavedListMenu's own title prop), never directive targets.
tests/ui/tooltips.spec.ts covers open-delay timing, a disabled control's hint, a hint inside an already-open popover, pointer-events: none, and the aria-describedby and auto-aria-label guarantees.

### v1 P23 Kafka tree reshape + stream-engine definitions
A Kafka topic is a leaf in the tree and no longer expands into partition rows, the way P19 made SQL tables leaves.
At the Kafka cluster root, topics show first and ungrouped, and only the auxiliary Consumer groups kind is foldered, by adding one row to P19's renderer-only GROUPED_KINDS table (no adapter change, no new NodeKind, no path segment, no IPC on expand).
caps.definition is true for Kafka and SQS; partition data is relocated into the definition view, not deleted.
ObjectDefinition has a generic sections list of name/value/detail rows, rendered by PropertiesSection.vue inside P19's existing definition view.
A Kafka topic definition shows partitions (id, leader, replicas, ISR) from metadata the tree already fetched, plus describeConfigs topic configuration with sensitive values masked.
A Kafka consumer group definition shows its state, members and committed offsets; previously consumer groups had no view.
An SQS queue definition shows its full GetQueueAttributes set.
The definition view no longer hard-requires describe(): it uses Promise.allSettled and meta may stay null. Its Open-in-console button is gated on caps.sql.
children() on a Kafka topic path is deliberately left intact, because the stream view's partition multiselect is a live second consumer of it.
Redis stays definition: false permanently, because key type/TTL/memory are already on every key/value page.
S3 stays definition: false as a named follow-up, because a bucket's properties need five SDK calls that a single-bucket IAM policy routinely denies.
Decision D2: topics stay ungrouped at the root, matching P19's SQL rule, rather than the plan's initial default of foldering the whole root; resolved after user feedback.
SQS is in scope for P23 (decision D9, the plan's default).
kafka/definition.ts and sqs/definition.ts degrade to a notes line rather than failing the tab when describeConfigs (Kafka) is denied.
tests/ui/definition.spec.ts passes unchanged as D8's regression guard that Postgres/MariaDB/Mongo definition tabs are unaffected.

### v1 P24 Search filter, cell editor fixes, expressive date picker, design cohesion
The grid's search toolbar has a filter toggle that narrows the grid to only the matched rows, client-side and reversibly, with its own "no matching rows" empty state.
Timestamp formats in the cell editor use a translate pane, on the same footing as the hex/base64 decoded-text pane, instead of the native datetime-local picker.
The timestamp translate pane has an editable field and an app-owned calendar picker (local/UTC toggle, month grid, time controls, a "now" shortcut). It syncs with the raw value in both directions in real time and re-encodes into the value's exact original shape.
P24 fixed cell-editor bugs: a stale disabled-reset tooltip, no keyboard way to abandon an edit, a truncated value that could be silently staged as a full-value write, and statusLine disagreeing with the buffer while typing.
The P24 design-cohesion sweep fixed sixteen findings (F1–F16): one icon size, one type scale, SegmentedControl and definition-section primitives replacing five sets of hand-rolled duplicates, and previously dead .is-invalid CSS states.
formatBytes is a single shared helper used from four places, replacing three divergent implementations.
The grid's view header shows the same kind/count/read-write/PK facts that every sibling view shows.
The P24 plan is in docs/plans/P24-search-filter-celleditor-dates-design.md; its §5 names the new scenarios added to tests/ui/data-view.spec.ts and cell-editor.spec.ts.

### v1 P25 Credential encryption at rest (Keychain)
Connection secrets (passwords, tokens, URIs with embedded credentials) move from plaintext in the SQLite connections table to OS Keychain-backed encryption, macOS Keychain via safeStorage first.
The storage layer is shaped so a Linux/Windows credential-store backend is a later adapter, not a rewrite.
P25 credential encryption must account for the Playwright harness, which drives a real headless Electron process and therefore a real, ask-free Keychain path in CI.
P25 is security hardening independent of other v1 features, deferred past the functional phases so it lands against a settled connection-record shape rather than one still changing under P17–P24.
secret-cipher.ts is the only file importing safeStorage, and it is probed once after app.whenReady().
Stored passwords are a kira:v1:<base64> envelope, and a pre-P25 plaintext row is upgraded on next launch.
duplicate() copies the stored ciphertext raw rather than decrypting it.
Decrypt/encrypt failures surface as real messages (reveal()'s {password, error}, the dialog's inline save error) instead of unhandled rejections.
The connection dialog's credential note reflects the platform's actual backend.
On Linux development, setting KIRA_INSECURE_SECRETS=1 enables an insecure development-fallback path for secrets, covered by tests/ui/secrets.spec.ts.
secrets.spec.ts scenario 1 deliberately asserts available === true and backend === 'keychain' rather than skipping, as D15's 'fail loudly, not silently' CI guard, so a macOS runner with a locked or absent default keychain produces a red build.
P25 was implemented with zero edits to any existing spec, per F12.

### v1 P26 Cell editor moves inside the data view
Before P26, the cell editor panel was a workbench-global singleton mounted once outside any per-tab tree, so switching tabs could leave it rendering the previous tab's cell.
The cell editor is now owned by each data-shaped view, mounted and torn down with the view like other per-tab state, so a tab switch cannot leave it stale; a view kind can opt out.
P26 was done before P27 reshapes the Mongo document view so P27 need not work around the cell-editor ownership issue; Mongo's document view has little use for the cell editor in its current form.
state/cellSelection.ts moved from one global slot to a per-tab-id record.
CellEditorDock.vue is the only mount point of the cell editor, added to every data-shaped view (grid, documents, key/value, stream, console); the shell mount and CellEditorPanel.vue were deleted.
The unmount-time selection clears that guarded the old shared slot were removed, so a backgrounded tab keeps its cell selection on switch-back.
A dirty cell editor buffer now stages on unmount, not just on blur, so a keyboard-driven tab switch cannot silently drop an in-flight edit.
Mongo's DocumentView.vue mounts the cell editor dock unchanged, per P26's boundary with P27.
P26 is implemented per docs/v1/plans/P26-cell-editor-in-data-view.md.

### v1 P27 Mongo document view redesign + ObjectId support + render perf
In the Mongo document view, a document's collapsed preview shows only its primary key by default, and all documents are expanded to just their first layer of keys.
Each Mongo document row has edit, expand/collapse and delete actions.
The cell editor panel (P26) is hidden by default for Mongo, and the document view no longer publishes to it; JSON beautify, byte count and revert live in the expanded document's own edit area.
The cell editor and the Mongo document row's edit area share one dirty/beautify/bytes/revert implementation via views/shared/useEditBuffer.ts and EditBufferActions.vue; beautify.ts was hoisted to the renderer root.
views/documents/ejson.ts recognises the closed EJSON v2 wrapper set by shape, without importing bson, and renders BSON values in Mongo shell form.
engine/adapters/mongo/literal.ts provides resolveEjsonWrappers and parseDocumentLiteral, so the filter box, mutate.ts and the document editor all accept shell constructors and extended JSON in the same document.
VirtualList.vue has an additive rowHeights prop (prefix-sum offsets, binary search) that backs documentRows.ts's exact per-row height model; DocumentTree.vue uses a flattened, CodeMirror-free read path, and DocumentView.vue's list uses this virtualizer.
The filter bar and Mongo console both offer the six BSON constructors as completions, and Copy _id and Copy document use the shell form.
P27 groups the preview reshape and the ObjectId work because they touch the same document-rendering code path; the render perf fix must be verified against the new reshape, not the code it replaces.
The ObjectId representation (bare string versus tagged {"$oid": ...}) was to be chosen after surveying how Compass and Studio 3T represent it.

### v1 P28 Connections panel: sticky group headers + checkbox filter
Scrolling the connections panel keeps the currently-open connection's group header pinned at the top until scroll passes into the next connection's group.
The connections panel filter is an expandable checkbox tree (by kind/tag and the tree's own grouping) instead of a regex/text match over the flat list.
tests/ui/support/tree.ts is the single band-aware copy of the Playwright tree helpers, replacing duplicated/flaky helpers across twenty files.
VirtualList.vue has an additive scrollstate emit and a zero-height #sticky overlay slot.
project/stickyBand.ts computes the pinned connection/database/schema band, capped at three rows and clamped to the viewport, purely from the flat row array and scroll offset.
ProjectTree.vue renders the sticky band as real TreeRows (sticky prop, distinct testid, tabindex=-1), so pinned rows are fully interactive.
grouping.ts labelForKind() is the single source of every node kind's display label, per connection kind.
The glob/regex rule list (connection_filters, shared/domain/connection-filter.ts) was replaced by a set of exclusions: TreeVisibility in shared/domain/tree-filter.ts, stored in connection_tree_filters (migration 0005).
Nothing ticked off in the filter is ever hidden, including an object fetched for the first time after the filter was saved.
project/filterTree.ts derives the filter dialog's kind rows, tri-state object rows and live consequence count from the same cached nodes the tree renders from, with no new IPC call.
FiltersDialog.vue is a two-section checkbox UI that opens focused on the row it was invoked from, with ancestors pre-expanded.

### v1 P29 Grid/cell-view scroll rendering gap
DataGrid.vue is the only two-axis-virtualized surface; every CodeMirror host runs EditorView.lineWrapping, so the cell editor has no horizontal scroll.
In DataGrid.vue, rowRange/colRange are derived through four primitive computeds so a sub-boundary scroll invalidates nothing downstream; before, they invalidated on every scroll pixel.
columns.ts's visibleColumnRange applies symmetric pixel overscan, capped per side; before it had zero column-axis overscan while the row axis had 560px.
displayCell/cellNavEntry results are computed once per render in renderRows's RowVM/CellVM, and the template reads fields only; before, the template re-evaluated them on every render (~126 calls per rendered cell).
cellNavEntry is gated on a navColumns precheck plus a narrow per-row value map, instead of building a whole-row snapshot before knowing whether a column has a nav affordance.
page.ts's decode cache prunes only the rows that left the window, instead of clearing entirely on every row boundary crossed during a fling.
.grid-row has contain: layout, added as a low-risk, low-cost change; its measured effect could not be isolated.
budgets.spec.ts includes horizontal/wide-table scroll measurements and overscan-coverage invariants using the app.scroll_grid fixture in tests/ui/support/pg.ts (60 columns x 5000 rows); they self-skip without a Docker daemon.
The P29 refactor is regression-guarded by the Docker-gated suite: data-view, mutations, interaction, tabs, leaks, cell-editor and perf.spec.ts.
P29 is specified in docs/v1/plans/P29-scroll-render-gap.md; its goal is to close the scroll blank gap by fixing virtualization/paint timing rather than masking it with a spinner.

### v1 P31 Cross-cutting polish and bug-fix batch
P31 batches sixteen small unrelated fixes (following P16's precedent) because none is large enough to be its own phase and several touch the same surfaces; batching needs one round of test:ui regression coverage instead of sixteen.
caps.describe is false for kafka, sqs, redis and s3, so the definition view's second load never fires for an adapter that cannot serve describe.
In CodeMirrorHost.vue the completion keymap is wrapped in Prec.highest so Arrow Up/Down reach the autocomplete popup; before, defaultKeymap's cursor-move won by array order.
The workbench has a 6px inset on three sides (left, right, top) from the window edge, and the tab strip scrolls horizontally (wheel included) once its tabs overflow.
renderer/fonts.ts checks font availability by canvas measurement, comparing a candidate family against a guaranteed-bogus probe, because document.fonts.check() returns true for anything; an unavailable font is reported honestly.
A font change re-measures every grid's column widths instead of reusing the old widths.
The grid, documents, keyvalue and stream in-page search toolbars share filter-toggle state via views/shared/searchFilter.ts, and restart their scan when the underlying page is replaced (pageVersion.n).
The Mongo documents view and the stream view have match highlighting and empty states, matching the grid and key-value views.
DateTimePicker.vue lives in views/shared/ and is used for the stream view's since-timestamp field, which validates on apply instead of silently discarding an unparseable value.
The grid gutter has a red pending-delete rail that is mutually exclusive with the yellow edit rail.
Delete or ⌘⌫ and the cell context menu's Delete row both work from a cell or range selection, not only a row selection.
The header sort chevron is a 13px codicon pinned to the cell's right edge; the redundant sort-direction text is dropped from the header label.
The Columns/Fields buttons show a plain indicator dot instead of an "N / M" text badge; the counts remain in the tooltip.
The preview command panel puts a blank line between staged statements.
typeGlossary.ts covers every SQL type family plus Mongo's BSON bsonType spellings, and the grid header tooltip includes the type description.
The project tree's twisty has no tooltip (it was redundant) but keeps its aria-label.
The "no colour" swatch in the connection color picker is a diagonal-slash mark, because a hollow ring read as a 13th hue.
The three saved/recent filter menus show full-text tooltips on every entry.
workbench.spec.ts's font-availability scenario is a real executable regression guard that is not Docker-gated; it caught two bugs in fonts.ts and a TextField/:invalid-prop snap-back bug in SettingsDialog.vue, all fixed.
The tests/db/ suites and tests/ui specs kafka, sqs, mongo, redis, data-view, tabs and tooltips are Docker-gated and self-skip without a Docker daemon, so they need a real run in CI or macOS/Colima, including tooltips.spec.ts's D25/D27 assertions.

### v1 P32 Kafka client migration + skip unnecessary group-join
The Kafka adapter uses @confluentinc/kafka-javascript pinned at 1.10.0 (Kafka 4-compatible) as a production dependency; kafkajs is removed from package.json, src and tests.
@confluentinc/kafka-javascript is a native, Electron-ABI-specific module built by scripts/native-electron-build.sh (marker + cache + electron-rebuild), wired as predev/pretest:ui/pretest:db:kafka/prepackage:mac instead of electron-builder's own rebuild step.
The Kafka adapter's client.ts, index.ts and produce.ts use the compat KafkaJS API behind one shared RdConfig.
Kafka errors.ts classifies errors by librdkafka numeric codes instead of kafkajs error names.
Kafka catalog.ts and definition.ts handle the array-shaped fetchTopicMetadata and numeric group-state/type enums, which are resolved to names and never shown as a bare digit.
A Kafka topic's Configuration section is permanently empty with a note, because the new client has no describeConfigs call.
The Kafka browse consumer (read.ts) uses assign() with explicit start offsets and a bounded poll loop and never calls subscribe(), so browsing never joins a consumer group.
The browse consumer's group.id stays a required-but-never-joined constant (kira-studio-browse) rather than a per-browse UUID.
The Kafka adapter suite runs under ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1 electron (test:db:kafka, tests/electron-db/kafka.spec.ts on node:test) instead of Bun, because Bun cannot load this driver at any ABI.
The Kafka seed fixture (tests/db/fixtures/0005_kafka_seed.ts) runs the broker's own CLI inside the test container instead of a JS client.
The Kafka test broker moved from cp-kafka:7.6.1 to 8.0.7 (Apache Kafka 4.0), the compatibility target of P32.
Kafka test scenarios 17–20 prove group-less browsing: no kira-studio-browse group appears in listGroups(), it has no committed offsets, a timestamp filter still seeks via fetchTopicOffsetsByTimestamp, and an oversized start offset is refused rather than silently truncated.
P32 is sequenced after P27's non-tabular-view lessons and P31's Kafka fixes so the client swap does not chase two moving targets in the same adapter.
The Kafka native build's blocker was the native ABI rebuild, not the image pull; confluentinc/cp-kafka pulls fine via mirror.gcr.io.
@confluentinc/kafka-javascript's build always tries to vendor-build zlib/libcurl/libcrypto/zstd from source (util/configure.js hardcodes --install-deps --source-deps-only), regardless of system packages.
Setting the CKJS_LINKING environment variable to dynamic makes util/configure.js skip the vendored build and link against the system's dev packages, avoiding source hosts blocked by the sandbox proxy (zlib.net, curl.se).
bun run test:db:kafka (21 cases) runs against a real broker; tests/ipc/kafka/kafka.backend.spec.ts uses real fixtures covering the tree, partition-filter popover children(), an offsetWindow stream read, and topic/consumer-group definitions.
In the Kafka tree, topics are ungrouped, each consumer group is its own root-level node, and 'Consumer groups' is a frontend-only folder over them, following D15's mysql/clickhouse precedent.
A Kafka read fans across both partitions and interleaves them by arrival, not key/offset order, so fixtures are sorted by key before being written.
The Kafka consumer group's coordinator host:port is non-deterministic (fresh Docker container hostname and host-mapped port each run) and is frozen in fixtures per D6.
tests/ui/kafka.spec.ts and tests/ui/support/kafka.ts were deleted once the backend fixture tests and UI half were both verified.

### v1 P33 S3: upload, download, delete, bounded edit
S3 objects support download, upload, delete, and edit; edit is allowed only where the object is small enough to render/parse.
Above a size threshold an S3 object is neither parsed nor rendered, following the grid's large-value-truncation precedent (§8.6), to avoid a stalled frame or runaway parse.
S3 mutation was deferred in P17 S3, which shipped read-only browsing only; P33 is that deferred work, reusing established mutation/editing patterns.
caps.fileTransfer is a new capability flag, true only for S3; for S3, canInsert, canUpdate, canDelete and writable are all true.
s3/mutate.ts uses the same sentinel-through-MutationRowOp technique as redis/mutate.ts, with _key plus $file/$contentType for an upload.
S3 insert refuses an existing key via a HeadObject probe, because S3 has no conditional-create.
An S3 edit's PutObject preserves every other HeadObject attribute (D11).
s3/transfer.ts is the only file in the S3 adapter that imports node:fs.
downloadObject streams to a .kira-partial-* temp file in the destination's own directory, renamed into place on success and unlinked on any failure or cancellation.
The S3 preview ceiling is 4 MB (OBJECT_BODY_PREVIEW_BYTES), with no Body row at all above it; this deliberately reverses the old 32 MB truncate-and-show (OQ1) since Download now serves large objects.
A separate 1 MB limit, OBJECT_BODY_EDIT_BYTES, gates S3 Edit; Edit also refuses a truncated or non-UTF-8 body, each with a tooltip naming the real reason.
main/ipc/files.ts provides one engine-neutral kira:files:chooseSave/chooseOpen IPC domain for native dialogs, with names basename()'d because an S3 key routinely contains /.
KeyValueView.vue's Download button is never blocked by read-only mode (D18).
KeyValueView.vue reuses its existing editOpen ref to swap in the inline ObjectBodyEditor.vue band for an S3 object, instead of a second popover model.
state/objectStore.ts lives in renderer/state/, not views/keyvalue/, so project/menus.ts can reach it; it holds upload-dialog state and the download/upload/delete flows driving UploadObjectDialog.vue.
The S3 demo seed (scripts/demo-dbs/s3/seed.sh) has a size/type ladder (empty/small/medium/over-edit-limit/over-preview-limit/binary), a >1000-object bulk/ prefix exercising ListObjectsV2's continuation loop, and a third kira-uploads-bucket for the empty-bucket-upload case.

### v1 P34 MySQL adapter
The MySQL adapter lives in engine/adapters/mysql/ and follows the fixed internal shape (index.ts, client.ts, query.ts, definition.ts, read.ts) that postgres/ and mariadb/ already establish.
MySQL was added as the last SQL adapter because new-engine work is cheapest once adapter-shape decisions have been exercised twice, and MySQL's dialect is closer to MariaDB's than any other engine, making it the lowest-risk addition.
P34 adds no new dependency: the MariaDB adapter's npm driver mariadb is a genuine dual MariaDB/MySQL client and is reused for MySQL.
engine/adapters/mysql-family/ is a shared core extracted byte-for-byte from mariadb/; its profile.ts defines a 3-field MysqlFamilyProfile (kind, serverLabel, applyEngineOptions), and a per-engine caps literal is passed separately.
mariadb/ keeps index.ts, caps.ts and client.ts with the real MariaDB profile and reduces query.ts, read.ts and definition.ts to re-exports of mysql-family; mysql/ mirrors that shape with the MySQL profile.
mapError in mysql-family/query.ts (renamed from mapMariaError) maps MySQL 8 caching_sha2_password handshake failures to E_AUTH: errno 45044 over a plaintext connection, and errno 45063 against a self-signed cert under sslmode=verify-full. The message names both remedies, sslmode=require or allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true.
shared/domain/connection.ts has the 'mysql' connection kind with DEFAULT_PORT 3306.
views/shared/sqlIdent.ts defines a SqlDialect = 'postgres' | 'mysql' family type, where mariadb and mysql share one dialect, plus sqlDialectFor(). It replaced twelve renderer call sites' hand-rolled kind checks, whose silent undefined fallback for an unhandled kind would have emitted invalid double-quoted identifiers for MySQL.
MySQL gets a real (non-empty) mark in EngineIcon.vue and _icons.html. ConnectionDialog.vue and grouping.ts gained the MySQL tile, an accent colour and the "Routines" folder label, which is shared with MariaDB.
tests/db/mysql.spec.ts ports mariadb.spec.ts's 33 scenarios 1:1 with four engine-difference adjustments: server version, no sequence kind, a wider composite_pk row-estimate band for MySQL's statistics cache, and view-not-sequence children. It adds five MySQL-specific scenarios, for 38 in total.
The five MySQL-specific test scenarios are two auth scenarios against never-authenticated users kira_nocache and kira_pubkey, native-JSON classification, absent integer display widths, and the big nested_json array surviving its WITH RECURSIVE seed port.
The MySQL fixture 0008_mysql_seed.sql and Testcontainers harness support/mysql.ts are byte-for-byte ports of the MariaDB ones. They substitute CHAR(36) for MariaDB's UUID type and a digits-cross-join numbers table for its SEQUENCE-based big_rows insert, because MySQL has neither.
tests/ui/mysql.spec.ts is a small deliberate subset of tests/ui/mariadb.spec.ts. Its load-bearing assertion is the dialect seam: a grid row's Filter by this value comes back backtick-quoted and narrows the grid.
scripts/demo-dbs/ has an eighth service, mysql:8.4, on host port 3307 because 3306 is already used by MariaDB. It has its own byte-parallel init.sql and seed.sql.
Several MySQL-specific findings in the P34 plan (the TLS path, the statistics-cache band, the JSON decode) were reasoned from driver/server source and are flagged in docs/v1/plans/P34-mysql-adapter.md as verify-on-container.

### v1 P35 SQLite adapter
The SQLite adapter lives in engine/adapters/sqlite/ and uses node:sqlite with no new dependency, because the app already relies on it for its own storage (main/storage/db.ts) and it ships in the engine's runtime (Electron/Node 22.5+ or Bun 1.4+, SQLite 3.53+).
The SQLite adapter stands alone with no shared 'family' pattern, because SQLite shares neither wire protocol nor driver with any other engine (P34's shared-driver reason does not apply).
shared/domain/connection.ts has the 'sqlite' kind and a FILE_KINDS set; in fields mode the database field holds the absolute file path, host/port are unused, and there is deliberately no DEFAULT_PORT entry.
In the SQLite adapter, every prepared statement touching real user data (never catalog/pragma queries) must use setReadBigInts(true), because an integer outside Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER would otherwise crash the whole page with ERR_OUT_OF_RANGE.
The SQLite value-to-text codec (toCellText) switches on the value's own JS type, not the column's declared type, because SQLite is dynamically typed.
SQLite keyset paging falls back from primary key to a unique index to the table's implicit rowid; rowid is never surfaced as a page column nor used as mutation identity.
MariaDB/MySQL/Postgres adapters degrade to offset paging where SQLite can use rowid as a stable keyset tiebreaker.
The SQLite adapter sets caps.cancel = false, because node:sqlite has no sqlite3_interrupt and its API is synchronous, so a running statement blocks the event loop and an AbortSignal cannot arrive while it runs.
SQLite mutate() wraps a batch in BEGIN IMMEDIATE/COMMIT/ROLLBACK rather than a deferred BEGIN, so a contended file fails before any row changes.
SQLite definition() returns sqlite_master.sql verbatim with constraints composed from pragmas; CHECK constraints have no catalog, so they are named as absent with a note pointing to the Source text.
ConnectionDialog.vue shows an isFileStyle-gated Database file field with a Browse… button instead of host/port/credentials for SQLite; kira:files:chooseOpen accepts an optional filters payload for this.
SqlDialect has 'sqlite' as a genuine third member, not an alias of 'postgres', wired through languages.ts's CodeMirror dialect and quoteIdent's double-quote default.
tests/db/sqlite.spec.ts ports mysql.spec.ts's 33 scenarios with SQLite adjustments plus seven SQLite-specific scenarios, including int64/BigInt fidelity, the file-is-not-modified guard (the phase's central promise), rowid keyset paging, a locked database surfacing E_TIMEOUT, and refusal of multi-statement input.
tests/db/support/sqlite.ts is a temp-file fixture (mkdtemp, seeded via node:sqlite, a single WITH RECURSIVE CTE for the 1M-row big_rows table), not a container, gated by sqliteAvailable()/SQLITE_UNAVAILABLE_MESSAGE rather than Docker.
tests/ui/sqlite.spec.ts is the first DB-backed UI spec that runs unconditionally (no Docker gate), and its load-bearing assertion mirrors the MySQL spec's backtick one but with double quotes.
scripts/demo-dbs/sqlite/seed.ts builds the SQLite demo database directly with node:sqlite, with no compose service, using the same e-commerce model as the other relational engines.
In catalog.ts, getReadTarget() must not treat a view as a rowid table, because PRAGMA table_list reports wr: 0 for views too; doing so crashed keyset-fallback reads on views with 'no such column: rowid'.

### v1 P36 ClickHouse adapter
The ClickHouse adapter lives in engine/adapters/clickhouse/ as a standalone eighth SQL-family adapter with ten files (index, client, query, catalog, read, mutate, console, definition, caps, errors) and no shared family, because ClickHouse shares neither wire protocol nor driver with any other adapter.
ClickHouse's OLAP conventions fit the fixed SQL-adapter shape once row identity is treated honestly; no divergent shape was needed.
The adapter uses @clickhouse/client@1, a plain JS HTTP client needing no native build.
The @clickhouse/client HTTP interface has no per-request database override; database comes only from client-construction config, so every statement relies on the connection's construction-time default database plus fully-qualified db.table identifiers (D19).
ClickHouse caps set canUpdate and canDelete permanently false and canInsert true, because a MergeTree PRIMARY KEY is a sparse index over parts, not a unique row key, so no addressable row exists for update/delete.
Never surface system.columns.is_in_primary_key as a PK badge in ClickHouse; toColumnMeta() hardcodes isPrimaryKey: false, because a badge would claim uniqueness the engine lacks.
ClickHouse mutate.ts insert-only assertColumnsKnown deliberately does not pre-block MATERIALIZED/ALIAS generated columns (D28); an explicit mutate() against one surfaces ClickHouse's native rejection verbatim (Adapter rule 4), while the renderer's insert paths gate them via a ColumnDescriptor.generated flag.
The ColumnDescriptor.generated flag is threaded through every adapter's read.ts/console.ts and the grid's add-row, paste and duplicate-as-insert paths.
ClickHouse definition() composes Engine, Sorting key, Primary key, Partition key, Total rows and Comment from system.tables, plus create_table_query verbatim minus its trailing semicolon, and two fixed notes on the sparse-index and no-FK facts.
ClickHouse is a fourth SqlDialect in views/shared/sqlIdent.ts and editor/languages.ts: backtick-quoted, backslashEscapes true, with its own keyword and type lists.
DataGrid, DataToolbar and gridMenu use a canDeleteRows computed to gate the −row button and delete menu by caps, separate from the edit-permission check, with a tooltip naming the real reason.
typeGlossary CLICKHOUSE_DESCRIPTIONS matches case-sensitively in PascalCase against un-lowercased type text, because ClickHouse Int8 and Postgres/MySQL int8 mean unrelated things.
unwrapClickHouseWrappers() recursively strips Nullable(...)/LowCardinality(...) before the generic single-level paren regex, which otherwise mangled Nullable(LowCardinality(String)).
tests/db/clickhouse.spec.ts has 45 scenarios using a ClickHouse testcontainer (@testcontainers/clickhouse@12.1.0) with fixture 0010_clickhouse_seed.sql; it proves duplicate-key rows via ReplacingMergeTree and cancels via KILL QUERY WHERE query_id = ... SYNC sent as a second HTTP request with a self-chosen query_id.
scripts/demo-dbs/ has a tenth service, clickhouse/clickhouse-server:26.3 on host port 8124, with its own init.sql and seed.sql re-expressing the e-commerce model in MergeTree terms via numbers() and a data_types_demo row showing ClickHouse's type family.

### v1 P37 RabbitMQ adapter
RabbitMQ fits the existing stream view (P10) on SQS's half (no addressable position, 'batch' pagination) once message data and topology data are kept apart, so it needs no new page kind.
RabbitMQ message routing key, headers and body map onto the five fixed stream columns, while exchanges, bindings and policies move into the definition view, as P23 did for a Kafka topic's partitions.
The RabbitMQ adapter adds no new dependency and uses the rabbitmq_management plugin's HTTP API via the platform's global fetch, because AMQP 0-9-1 cannot enumerate queues, exchanges or bindings; an AMQP client was rejected as a second protocol with no enumeration benefit.
The adapter lives in engine/adapters/rabbitmq/ (index, caps, client, query, catalog, read, mutate, definition, errors; no console.ts because caps.sql is false).
Every RabbitMQ HTTP call goes through query.ts's single request()/requestAll() pair, so the default-vhost %2F encoding, per-request AbortSignal, Authorization header and op-log command text are each written once.
The RabbitMQ adapter's canUpdate and canDelete are permanently false, because a RabbitMQ message has no broker-assigned identity and AMQP has no per-message update or delete.
RabbitMQ mutate() accepts only insert, a publish through an exchange defaulting to the default exchange with the queue's name as routing key; a publish the broker accepts but routes nowhere ({"routed":false}) is reported as an error.
RabbitMQ reads are poll-on-demand with ackmode reject_requeue_true so nothing is removed (messages return marked redelivered), clamped to 500 messages (the management API's page-size ceiling).
RabbitMQ reads request truncation one byte over the budget, so an oversized payload the broker doesn't fully truncate is still marked truncated by the page builder's own logic.
RabbitMQ connect() issues exactly one request (GET /api/overview) and gives distinct messages for wrong credential, no management plugin, and pointing at AMQP port 5672 instead of management port 15672; an amqp:// URI is refused.
A RabbitMQ virtual host reuses the existing database NodeKind with a per-connection-kind label override rendering it "Virtual host"; exchange is the one new NodeKind, a definition-only leaf foldered under an "Exchanges" heading like Kafka consumer groups in P23.
The nameless default exchange is filtered out of every listing, because its blank name cannot survive the app's path/tab-title plumbing.
tests/db/rabbitmq.spec.ts (27 scenarios) runs against a RabbitMQ testcontainer using @testcontainers/rabbitmq@12.1.0, with its wait strategy overridden from the AMQP-era log line to an HTTP probe of the management port; it includes a P13 tripwire of exactly two GETs per vhost expansion regardless of object count.
A RabbitMQ stream-type queue's basic.get refusal is reclassified from a generic query error to E_UNSUPPORTED, and the credential never reaches op_log.command text.
tests/ui/rabbitmq.spec.ts is a small Docker-gated subset (no local-file equivalent for a broker) asserting that the queue tab never auto-loads with a requeue-worded warning, Poll shows the routing key in the key column, and no Delete-message button appears.
scripts/demo-dbs/ has an eleventh service, rabbitmq:4.3.5-management-alpine, on host port 15672 with the AMQP port deliberately not published, seeded by a host-side seed.sh using curl against localhost:15672 because the image has no bulk-publish CLI.

### v1 P39 Modularity and cleanliness
P39 (Modularity and cleanliness) is a user-directed post-v1 phase, not a SPEC §10 deliverable, that reorganizes structure with zero behavior change; nothing in it touches themes (P38 was skipped by user direction).
P39 runs as three iterations per CLAUDE.md's multi-pass convention; each is its own Opus-plan/Sonnet-implement cycle against the tree the previous iteration left, with its own plan file (P39-modularity-and-cleanliness.md, -iter2.md, -iter3.md).
P39 was split into rounds rather than one larger plan because structure debt accumulated over 38 phases faster than a single pass could safely find and fix.
P39 iteration 1 enforced SPEC §11's layering: views/* no longer imports workbench/* or a sibling views/*.
P39 iteration 1 collapsed five near-duplicate data-view modules (page store, chunked scanner, find-widget toolbar, page-size table, load-error classifier) into shared implementations under views/shared/.
After P39 iteration 1, every adapter except RabbitMQ uses one shared errors.ts/mapError.
resolveProjection and safeInt were hoisted into sql-text.ts, and a single unsupported()/noQueryConsole() pair replaced twenty capability-stub throws.
The four data-view folders share one naming scheme: page.ts, search.ts, menu.ts, mutations.ts.
shared/port.ts, layout.ts, settings.ts and shortcuts.ts were moved to match SPEC §11's own tree.
Every data-testid stayed unchanged during P39 iteration 1.
In state/tabs.ts, six patchers differ: three skip the save on a no-op patch and three don't. A naive merge would change behavior, so the difference is kept as an explicit skipUnchanged flag per caller; which behavior is the bug is deferred to the functionality-review phase (P43).
The functionality-review phase is P43, renumbered from P40 when P40/P41 (console UX, Redis/S3 tree navigation) were inserted, then from P42 when a console/grid/cell-editor polish batch was inserted ahead of it.

### v1 P40 Query console UX and cell-editor read-only mode
Each console result set has a stable key from resultPageKey(tabId, seq) in views/console/state.ts, using the tab's own monotonic nextSeq and never an array index, so closing one result set never re-keys its siblings.
The query console shows one result set at a time behind a .p-tab-chip strip (console-result-strip, console-result-tab, console-result-close), replacing the old stacked-panel-per-statement layout.
The fixed 260px-height .result-panel was removed and the active console grid is flex: 1, like the data grid's .grid-area, which fixed the empty band below the last row when the cell editor is closed.
A console toolbar toggle (console-new-result-toggle) decides whether a run's result is appended as a new result set or replaces the current one; it is persisted per tab as consoleTabStateSchema.newResultSet, default false, so already-saved tabs restore unchanged.
views/console/search.ts is the fourth createPageSearch call site, after grid, documents and keyvalue.
activePage(tabId) in console state.ts is the single place that resolves which of a tab's result sets is active, so the two shared cleanup handlers in views/shared/page/ need no per-result-set key scheme.
setActiveResult bumps pageVersion in resultPages.ts so an open find re-scans the newly active result.
CellEditorDock and CellEditorView have an optional readOnly prop, default false, so the other four mounts are unchanged. When true (viewer mode) there is no reason chip (data-read-only="true", no data-read-only-reason) and no UUID-generate, modified, byte-badge, Beautify or Revert.
The read-only cell editor omits the reason chip's data-read-only-reason because no write was ever on offer to refuse; the hidden affordances either did nothing meaningful on a console cell or misrepresented why.
ConsoleResultGrid.vue's header dropped the p-badge data-type badge for the same hover tooltip (name, type, glossary description) as DataGrid.vue's header cell, plus row-hover and tabular-nums parity.
P43 iteration 1 fixed two defects found during P40: stream and documents mounted the cell editor with no write path (F14), and resultPages.ts's setVisibleWindow had no caller (F22), so the console's decode cache was never pruned like the grid's.
P40 is a user-directed, post-v1 phase, not a SPEC §10 deliverable, implemented per docs/v1/plans/P40-query-console-ux-and-readonly-cell-editor.md.

### v1 P41 Redis/S3 tree navigation and the sticky header fix
The sticky ancestor-band bug was caused by DOM order in theme/primitives/VirtualList.vue, not by stickyBand.ts geometry: the sticky slot rendered after the header/top-spacer, so the position: sticky; top: 0 box never engaged from flow position 0. Fixed by moving the slot to be the first child.
The caps.keyBrowser boolean is true only for redis and s3 and marks an engine whose top-level container hides an unbounded, arbitrarily-nested key/object space.
The connection tree keeps only top-level containers (S3 buckets, Redis databases) as leaves: redis/catalog.ts database node and s3/catalog.ts bucket node have hasChildren: false, and key/object navigation moved to a dedicated Browse panel.
project/grouping.ts isLeafKind, project/state/tree.ts revealPath and project/filterTree.ts use the keyBrowser flag so a keyBrowser container is treated as a leaf like a table/topic.
A 'browse' tab kind (shared/domain/tabs.ts, views/browse/{state,BrowseView.vue,menu.ts}) shows exactly one level at a time, with Up/breadcrumb navigation and a client-side substring filter.
Browse tab state.levelPath persists which level a reactivated tab resumes at, per the §8.4 identity rule (unchanged).
Container/key/object row menus were moved verbatim from the tree's now-deleted namespaceMenu/prefixMenu/keyMenu/objectMenu into the Browse panel.
uploadMenuItem lives in state/objectStore.ts so the tree's bucket row and the Browse panel's container rows share one upload entry point without crossing the project/ → views/ layering rule.
state/viewCommands.ts's leaf-registry pattern was extended with registerBrowseInvalidate/browseInvalidate for Browse invalidation.
The entry points into a Browse tab are ProjectTree.vue's onOpen and project/menus.ts's browseMenuItem, which is first in the menu ahead of Refresh.
redis.spec.ts, s3.spec.ts and memory.spec.ts open and drive a Browse tab instead of tree-based namespace/prefix/key/object navigation, and assert that no prefix row exists in the tree.
tests/ui/sqlite.spec.ts has inline-height sticky-band assertions covering the sticky header fix.
UploadObjectDialog.vue's containerPrefix computed captured only the container's immediate local segment (pathTail), so uploading via an S3 prefix nested 2+ levels deep dropped ancestor segments from the prefilled key; fixed in P43.

### v1 P42 Console, grid and cell-editor polish batch
The query console's newResultSet setting defaults to true, so a run opens a new result tab by default; an explicit saved 'off' from before this phase still restores off, because an explicit preference outranks a changed default.
Query console result tabs have a right-click menu with Close, Close others and Close to the right; the result-chip strip uses --kira-h-sm height with wheel-to-horizontal scrolling shared with the main tab strip via renderer/wheelScroll.ts.
The document view files (ejson.ts, documentRows.ts, DocumentTree.vue) live in views/shared/document/, and rows.ts's dependency on documents/page.ts is inverted into a registered row source.
The Mongo console result uses the shared document view, collapsed by default (unlike the data tab's expanded default, since a console run is usually a shape-skimming glance at many documents), with no edit/delete affordance.
lintMongoConsole checks arguments with the shell-literal parser tryParseShellText (exported from ejson.ts), not JSON.parse, because Mongo statement grammar allows ObjectId(…)/ISODate(…) constructors that a plain JSON parser would reject.
Word wrap is a single appearanceSettingsSchema.wordWrap setting (default true, matching prior hard-coded behavior), applied in CodeMirrorHost.vue through a fifth Compartment, replacing per-component hard-coding.
The grid supports drag-to-select (mousedown, mouseenter while held, mouseup, with auto-scroll at the viewport edge); its corner cell selects everything as one range selection, never a row selection, which would be an O(rows) Array.includes inside the render loop.
Two adjacent selected grid cells share one border at their common edge using four independent box-shadow custom properties, rather than each drawing a full outline.
The numeric stepper's chevrons are fixed via the icon prop rather than a CSS override, because CodiconIcon's inline font-size style beats an external rule.
Every scroll container's corner square is transparent instead of Chromium's opaque white default.
workbench/state/tooltip.ts accepts a structured { title, meta?, body? } as well as a plain string; the grid/console-result column header tooltip is the first caller, and the plain-text data-kira-tip mirror is unchanged.
The cell editor's format picker drops uuid and url formats because both were inert on selection; detectUuid's regex remains as a guard inside detectBase64 so a real UUID is not mis-detected as base64.
The iso8601 format label is "Time (ISO…)", and the format list is reordered common-first into three groups.
The cell editor's validate.ts checks the buffer against the effective format (JSON/XML balance, CSV column-count consistency, SQL lint error, parseable timestamp, decodable base64/hex shape) and shows a named "invalid" chip.
The cell editor's format picker is an app-drawn ContextMenu instead of a native select, because a native option sits outside elementFromPoint's reach and per-row hover explanations (FORMAT_HELP, also used by the trigger's tooltip) need it; arrow-key navigation of the native control was lost.
The cell editor's generators panel has four entries (UUID v4, ULID, a random hex token, "Now") and is never format-gated.
EditBufferActions has a showBytes prop (default true); the cell editor passes false so the byte figure is not duplicated with the status badge.
DateTimePicker.vue's month/year label is a button cycling three views (days, a 3×4 month grid, a 4×4 16-year block); prev/next arrows page the active view, and picking a month or year moves only the calendar view, never the selected value.
CONNECTION_COLOR_CHOICES offers eight swatches (none, red, amber, green, cyan, blue, magenta, grey) at a 42° minimum OKLCH hue gap, versus the full palette's worst gap of 25.6° (blue↔indigo).
connectionColorSchema stays whole, because narrowing it would make a connection saved with a retired colour silently vanish on next launch rather than merely stop being offered.
runChunkedScan takes an optional priority window scanned in its own animation frame first, then runs the ordinary ascending pass from row 0 rebuilding the match list from scratch, so the published order stays strictly ascending.
Every scan tick publishes into searchState marked pending, so the filter toggle (matchedRows()) waits for a completed scan before hiding rows, avoiding hide-then-unhide flicker.
views/shared/page/visibleRows.ts carries each tab's on-screen row window to the scanner, reported by DataGrid.vue's bounds watch and a VirtualList.vue visible-range emit forwarded by DocumentView.vue and ConsoleResultGrid.vue.
KeyValueView.vue renders every loaded row without virtualization, so it has no visible window to report and keeps ascending-only scan priority while still getting progressive publication.

### v1 P43 Functionality review
P43 is a user-directed, post-v1 functionality review phase (not a SPEC §10 deliverable), run as three iterations; unlike P39 it may change behavior.
S3 upload through a nested prefix keeps every ancestor segment, not just the immediate parent, via containerPrefix in UploadObjectDialog.vue.
ConsoleResultGrid.vue's decoded-cell cache prunes as it scrolls, using resultPages.ts's setVisibleWindow, which is now wired to a caller.
The stream and document cell-editor docks no longer offer a write path that silently did nothing.
A NUL byte in a ClickHouse identifier is rejected instead of reaching the query.
A failed commit's server error reaches the grid, and every immediate mutation surfaces its own failure the same way.
A filter change invalidates the tab's stale row count.
A disconnect returns every open tab to Reconnect & load, not just the tab that noticed.
A committed mutation reloads every other tab open on the same target; a key/object mutation refreshes an open Browse tab; a failed mutation still invalidates the target's cached pages.
Mongo's offset-cursor skip guard fires only on a genuine page jump (offset > 0), not on page one's { offset: 0 }.
Redis list pagination no longer clamps to the 500-row LIST_WINDOW, so a requested page size is honoured.
Kafka's readTopic clamps a window whose high watermark falls inside an uncommitted transaction gap.
useRunState in state/runState.ts prefers a still-running op over a newer finished one, so the toolbar ring does not go dark mid-query.
metadata-cache.ts has a per-connection MAX_ROWS_PER_CONNECTION eviction pass.
TreeChildren's wire shape is { nodes, truncated? } across every adapter, engine/control.ts, both protocol layers and the renderer's Browse view, so a round-capped listing reports truncation.
The cell editor's selection clears on every page change across console, keyvalue and stream views, not just the grid.
A truncated cell value never reports as broken JSON.
A generated ULID's timestamp half decodes to the real date; toCrockford's trailing-pad encoder was wrong for a 50-bit left-padded field.
A closed console result set releases its parsed documents and expansion state instead of leaking them.
A superseded search scan never republishes stale matches, and an open inline grid editor no longer acts as a drag-select handle.
Docker-free bun:test specs over a bun:sqlite + drizzle-orm/sqlite-proxy harness (tests/db/metadata-cache.spec.ts, tests/db/run-state.spec.ts) verify the metadata-cache eviction and run-state behavior.
A truncated children refresh drops the stale complete-looking cache row it couldn't replace, rather than serving it without a truncation strip.
views/browse/state.ts has a per-tab supersession guard like other views' load(), so a slow Redis/S3 listing cannot land after the user navigated elsewhere.
Refresh on a cursor-paged Redis key (hash/set/zset/stream) returns the pager to page one instead of drifting forward.
The find toolbar keeps the match the user navigated to mid-scan once the scan finishes, rather than snapping back to the first hit.
DocumentTree.vue scrolls sideways so long values in expanded documents are reachable, using the same chrome-less idiom as TabStrip.vue and ConsoleView.vue.
Every ContextMenu.vue menu, including the cell editor's format picker, has roving keyboard navigation.
Whole-row or whole-column grid selections draw their own end caps instead of leaving the outline open.
Caps has an optional maxPageSize so the stream page-size picker doesn't offer RabbitMQ sizes a basic.get poll can never serve.

### v1 P44 Unit tests
Phase P44 is a user-directed, post-v1 phase (not a SPEC §10 deliverable) that adds unit tests sparingly: only where there is enough logic to justify one, and prefer a unit test over existing Playwright UI coverage when both could apply.
tests/db/ is out of scope for new unit tests: no file is added to it, moved out of it, or edited in it.
Put every new unit spec in tests/unit/, which has its own tsconfig.json, a typecheck:unit script folded into bun run typecheck, and a test:unit script, mirroring tests/db/.
The two Docker-free specs metadata-cache.spec.ts and run-state.spec.ts from P43 iteration 3 remain in tests/db/; moving them (a git mv plus two prose citations) is handed to P45, whose remit includes the repo folder structure.
P44 added five unit specs: shared/domain/sql-split.ts lexical regimes, engine/adapters/sql-text.ts keyset-eligibility/page-token logic, views/shared/page/scan.ts scheduler, redis/s3 catalog truncated flag, and the load supersession/cursor-strategy reload in views/browse/state.ts and views/keyvalue/state.ts.
The scan.ts frame-driven scheduler is tested with a queue-based fake requestAnimationFrame that hands out frames one at a time, because a settled-end-state Playwright test cannot observe the state between two frames.
The redis/s3 catalog truncated flag is tested with hand-written fake clients across all 200/20 round-cap rounds, avoiding seeding hundreds of thousands of keys in a live assertion.
The load supersession guard in views/browse/state.ts and the cursor-strategy reload in views/keyvalue/state.ts are tested with manually resolved promises that force the older-lands-after-newer interleaving, which Playwright cannot force on demand.
If a defect surfaces while writing a unit spec, write it up and hand it to §8; do not fix it under a test: commit.
The Testcontainers-backed suites are the only prior coverage of sql-text.ts and sql-split.ts paths and only walk the eligible-and-correct path.

### v1 P45 Docs cleanup
SPEC.md and its plans/ are retired as v1 history, not a living spec; what is still true and durable lives in ARCHITECTURE.md, which CLAUDE.md points to and which points out to PACKAGING.md and PERF.md.
SPEC.md and docs/v1/plans/ were not moved, because 56 in-repo citations name docs/v1/plans/ by path (six in live src/ and tests/ comments); moving would dangle them and force retro-editing frozen history (D57/D58).
ARCHITECTURE.md, PACKAGING.md and PERF.md live in docs/, and design/ lives in docs/design/, so docs/*.md is living documentation; docs/v1/ holds only SPEC.md, plans/ and an archive-banner README.md as the v1 record.
ARCHITECTURE.md is authoritative over SPEC.md; SPEC.md's front matter was rewritten to invert authority to ARCHITECTURE.md (D60/D61).
ARCHITECTURE.md absorbed the process model, storage, caching, the §5.1 per-engine mapping table, the stack and §2's invariants, pointing to docs/PERF.md §1 for budget numbers instead of duplicating the table (D62).
ARCHITECTURE.md has a ~55-line UI architecture section distilled rather than copying SPEC §8's 604 UI lines verbatim (D63); it covers view-kind-by-page-kind selection, tab-identity rule, session-restore reconnect gate, staged-vs-immediate write model, per-view mounted cell editor panel, Browse panel's one-level model, and shared find/chunked-scan machinery.
Test layout rule (D66): tests/unit/ needs nothing external and finishes in about a second, while tests/db/ and tests/electron-db/ need a real external resource; tests/ has four directories.
preconnect.spec.ts stays in tests/db/ because it spawns real OS processes and measured 23.0s of a 24.1s total; metadata-cache.spec.ts and run-state.spec.ts moved to tests/unit/.
Bun's shared module registry makes specs' inline window stubs race for which one wins for the whole test run, so a shared tests/unit/support/window.ts is used instead.
The real v1 implemented range is P0–P37; P38 was skipped by user direction.

### v1 P46 Disable unnecessary Chromium/Electron features
Phase P46 (post-v1, user-directed, not a SPEC §10 deliverable) audits the app's Electron/Chromium surface and disables capabilities the app does not use.
Renderer hardening lives in src/main/security.ts (rendererWebPreferences, hardenSession, hardenWindow); its only electron import is import type, so it unit-tests without mocking.
Every P46 disable is backed by a reproduction against the shipped renderer, not an inference from Electron's hardening checklist.
Before hardening, window.open to a remote URL returned a live handle (window count 1→2), and location.href to a remote origin navigated the real app away and destroyed the workbench; the meta CSP does not govern top-level navigation.
Without a permission handler, every Chromium permission (notifications, geolocation, media, device APIs) was granted by default.
With devTools: true in a packaged build, openDevTools() stayed reachable even though menu.ts's dev gating already closed the keyboard shortcut path.
Spellchecker was enabled on a stock window, so it would spellcheck the connection dialog's password field when the eye toggle reveals it; it is now disabled.
autocomplete="off" is set on the shared TextField.vue component, which about sixty call sites share.
electron-builder.yml sets three Electron fuses to false (runAsNode, enableNodeOptionsEnvironmentVariable, enableNodeCliInspectArguments) to close a Node inspector on the main process in packaged builds.
Never make the permission handler deny-all; allowlist only clipboard-read and clipboard-sanitized-write, shared by the request and check handlers, because deny-all broke navigator.clipboard (grid paste and the 38 copyText call sites in clipboard.ts).
Never turn off grantFileProtocolExtraPrivileges, because it bricks the app: the renderer's script type=module crossorigin loaded over file:// is CORS-refused without it.
scripts/verify-packaging.sh has static checks S6/S7 guarding that the three safe fuses are set and that grantFileProtocolExtraPrivileges stays untouched.
Background throttling stays on, because nothing on the quit-flush or run-state-ticker paths depends on a hidden window's timers running unthrottled.
Hardware acceleration stays on because the grid's scroll budget depends on GPU compositing.
Electron disableDialogs/safeDialogs are not enabled, because window.confirm() gates six destructive actions and replacing them is a UI change for a future phase.
No --disable-features command-line switch list was added, because such a list is fail-open and untestable, and the capabilities it would target either don't exist in the app or have a first-class, assertable Electron API.
Hardening is tested by tests/ui/hardening.spec.ts (Docker-free, ten scenarios) plus tests/unit/security.spec.ts and menu.spec.ts.

### v1 P47 `@tanstack/vue-virtual` spike
P47 is a post-v1 spike, not a SPEC §10 deliverable, gated by an evidence-based go/no-go decision (D14): replace DataGrid.vue's hand-rolled row/column virtualization with @tanstack/vue-virtual's row/column virtualizers.
Swapping the virtualization library risks silently regressing the P29 invariants: overscan coverage, zero-mutation sub-row scrolls, and DOM-cell bounds.
On the row axis, ceil(560 / 28) = 20 overscan rows reproduces the old fixed overscan-row count exactly, bridging P29's 560px pixel-budget overscan.
The column axis bypasses the library's own overscan and uses visibleColumnRange's expansion loop unchanged as a custom rangeExtractor (columnRangeExtractor in columns.ts), so the same pixel budget and per-side cap apply.
TanStack's default observeElementRect measures the scroll element's border-box size, which does not subtract a visible scrollbar's thickness (unlike clientWidth/clientHeight). On scroll_grid this ~12-15px discrepancy caused 65 DOM mutations on a 4px sub-row scroll, failing budgets.spec.ts's zero-mutation assertion.
DataGrid.vue uses a custom observeElementRect (observeScrollElementRect) that measures clientWidth/clientHeight via its own ResizeObserver instead of TanStack's border-box default.
The D14 verdict for the @tanstack/vue-virtual spike is go: all five no-go criteria were clean, and columns.ts loses visibleColumnRange's 43-line binary-search-plus-expansion-loop for the smaller columnRangeExtractor seam.
The migration improved all three D13 work-p50 metrics: big_rows vertical 2.4→2.2ms, scroll_grid horizontal 6.3→6.2ms, scroll_grid vertical/wide-table 6.2→5.1ms (see docs/PERF.md §2.1).
columnRangeExtractor has a dedicated unit spec, tests/unit/column-range.spec.ts, with 7 cases covering both caps, both edge clamps, single-column, narrower-than-viewport, zero-column, and uniform and variable widths (D16).
budgets.spec.ts and perf.spec.ts needed no edits for the TanStack migration (D17).

### v1 P48 Cross-view reusability audit
P48 is a user-directed post-v1 cross-view reusability audit-and-refactor (not a SPEC §10 deliverable) of the six data-view kinds, their ViewChrome toolbars and the backend engine adapters; it extracts shared configurable primitives only where duplication is real, not merging things that merely look alike.
P48 was motivated by the user report that a fix or improvement made in one data view isn't reflected in its siblings, because apparently shared components were often two independently maintained ones.
P48 held zero-behavior-change discipline (D0) except two commits: countOpId ignores a superseded row-count response on document/key-value/stream tabs (ported from grid/state.ts), and the data grid's own 1px chrome border was dropped when it adopted ViewChrome.
All data-testids were preserved in P48 except document-prev/document-next, renamed to document-pager-prev/document-pager-next with the shared Pager.vue.
errors.ts has throwIfCancelled, which re-checks cancellation after an await (the mid-flight sibling of assertNotCancelled, which runs before a call starts); it replaced 26 duplicated copies across eight adapters.
abort.ts's withAbortRace implements the callback-style abort/settle race shared by the postgres and mysql-family adapters, replacing six copies.
shared/protocol/page.ts's unpagedPosition replaced ten copies of the unpaged-position literal.
sql-text.ts holds the SQL read path's shared keyset planning (assertKeysetSupported, resolveFetchColumns, buildScanOrderBy, buildKeysetPosition for postgres/mysql/sqlite) and count/filter logic (whereClause, parseCountValue), plus primaryKeyFromIndexes/resolveKeyShape moved from postgres's and mysql-family's catalog modules.
requireConnected is the shared connected-handle guard in the adapters, replacing ten copies.
createRuntimeStore provides setActionError, toggleSearchOpen and setSearchOpen, replacing five per-view copies.
viewOp.ts provides beginOp/applyLoadFailure, used by the load paths of grid, documents, keyvalue, stream and console; browse keeps its own loadSeq-based supersession (D18).
views/shared/page/store.ts is the single page-cache implementation behind all five page modules.
views/shared/immediateMutation.ts backs the ten immediate-mutation writers of documents, keyvalue and stream.
views/shared/page/search.ts's createMatchIndex and scan.ts's emptyScan/tabularRowScanner/keyValueRowScanner are the shared find-toolbar match index and row scanners for all views.
DataView.vue (the SQL grid) mounts ViewChrome like every other view, with DataToolbar/FilterToolbar targeting ViewChrome's named slots; its hand-rolled ViewHeader/.p-toolbar-rail was deleted.
views/shared/page/Pager.vue is the pager shared by the grid and the document list.
views/shared/document/DocumentRow.vue carries the Mongo document row head, shared by DocumentView.vue and ConsoleResultGrid.vue, each supplying its own #actions/#body slot content.
views/shared/page/columns.ts exports columnHeaderTooltip, GUTTER_WIDTH and DEFAULT_COLUMN_WIDTH, shared by DataGrid.vue and ConsoleResultGrid.vue; the CSS gutter width is the --gutter-width custom property.
biome.json's views/<kind>/* sibling-import restriction group now includes browse, the seventh view folder, which had been uncovered since P41.

### v1 P49 Vue/Node ecosystem library spike
P49 spike concluded no Vue/Node ecosystem library is worth adopting; P47's @tanstack/vue-virtual adoption for the SQL grid stays.
@tanstack/vue-virtual is not extended to VirtualList.vue's other six call sites, because every one is single-axis and TanStack's demonstrated win was specifically the column axis.
VirtualList.vue has three features with no library equivalent: a precomputed rowHeights prefix sum, in-flow sticky slots, and a pixel-inset scrollToIndex.
Pinia, TanStack Query, TanStack Form, VueUse, vue-router, a third-party component kit, drizzle-kit and lru-cache were each rejected for architecture-specific reasons.
TanStack Query is rejected because the cache already lives in the engine process, every read is a logged operation, cancellation is server-side, and a cursor-paged page has no stable key.
@floating-ui/vue is the one library marked 'revisit later' by the P49 spike.
ConsoleResultGrid.vue now shares DataGrid.vue's columnRangeExtractor, GUTTER_WIDTH and DEFAULT_COLUMN_WIDTH behind a second TanStack column virtualizer, while its rows stay on VirtualList.vue; previously it rendered every column of every visible row with no cap.
ConsoleResultGrid keeps rows on VirtualList.vue because nothing on the row side showed a symptom (the conservative half of D4's open question).
KeyValueView.vue and StreamView.vue now mount VirtualList.vue; before, they rendered every loaded row directly with no virtualization, up to 10,000 rows.
OVERSCAN_PX, MAX_OVERSCAN_COLUMNS and observeScrollElementRect live in views/shared/page/columns.ts so both grids' column axes share them and avoid a second copy.
theme/anchoredPosition.ts is one pure function parametrized by a 'menu'/'callout' strategy that replaces the hand-rolled overlay positioners in PopoverPanel.vue, AppTooltip.vue and ErrorPopover.vue, which had drifted apart and shipped a bug.
ContextMenu.vue is left untouched by the anchoredPosition refactor because it is mouse-anchored, a deliberately different positioning model.
tests/ui/sqlite.spec.ts has a scenario showing console column virtualization: a 200-column single-row query renders well under 200 DOM cells, including after scrolling to the far right where the last column's value is visible.
tests/ui/redis.spec.ts checks the status line's loaded-count instead of a DOM node count for a 30-row list, since that exceeds VirtualList's default overscan; a new test bounds DOM nodes for a 5000-field Redis hash's 100-row page.

### v1 P50 UI test suite split: IPC-boundary backend tests and mocked-IPC frontend tests
The tests/ui/ per-adapter Playwright specs are split at the IPC boundary into two tiers: only 2–3 specs (sqlite, mongo, s3) stay as full end-to-end coverage; other adapters get a backend test and a frontend test.
A backend test drives the real IPC control-channel handler against a real (Testcontainers or file-backed) data store with no Electron renderer; a frontend test drives the real rendered UI in Playwright/Electron with the IPC layer mocked, asserting rendering/interaction only.
The frontend test's mock payload and the backend test's checked fixture must live in the same file in the same folder, so a backend assertion fails first if the backend stops producing a shape the frontend mocks.
The IPC backend tier is its own suite (tests/ipc/**/*.backend.spec.ts, run by bun run test:ipc:be) and does not join tests/db/, a repo convention.
The IPC backend files must stay out of tests/db/ because bun run test:db is a directory glob that Bun would try to run those files under and fail.
tests/db/ covers the adapter against a real container, while tests/ipc/ covers the four layers above the adapter: control channel, data-op dispatch, tree/metadata cache, port framing.
Each tests/ipc adapter folder holds three files sharing one name: <adapter>.backend.spec.ts, <adapter>.frontend.spec.ts, <adapter>.fixture.ts; colocation of both halves and the fixture is the binding rule, not a directory split.
window.kira is deeply frozen and non-configurable, so renderer-side IPC mocking is impossible; the control channel is mocked by swapping ipcMain handlers in the main process via ElectronApplication.evaluate.
The bulk-data port is mocked by posting a fresh MessageChannel's port1 through the same {__kira:'port'} door production code already listens on for reload/reconnect.
The control mock excludes a request's tabId from its arg-matching key, because it is a per-tab UUID generated by the renderer at open time and cannot be reproduced from a fixture; the port mock likewise ignores opId/tabId.
Real containers in this sandbox are pulled via mirror.gcr.io, a Docker Hub read-through mirror not blocked by the network policy, unlike Docker Hub directly or quay.io; this is recorded in CLAUDE.md.
tests/ipc/support/harness.spec.ts proves the IPC test harness itself without Docker, using a temp-file SQLite fixture.
In the MySQL split, the "Routines" folder is a frontend-only grouping over real leaf-kind nodes; the backend has no "folder" node kind at all.
The kept full-stack anchors sqlite.spec.ts, mongo.spec.ts and s3.spec.ts each carry a header comment naming what they are now the sole proof of.
tests/db/ is exhaustive adapter-edge coverage, while the tests/ipc backend half is one linear fixture-capturing scenario per adapter, so similar-looking assertions mostly test different layers.
For redis, truncated is asserted undefined at the adapter level and false at the IPC level, both correct, because tree-service.ts normalizes what the adapter omits.
Duplicate assertions found by the db-vs-ipc review were removed from the tests/ipc backend specs only (rabbitmq default-exchange and poll routing-key; sqs empty-queue count), never from tests/db/ (P50 D1).

### v1 P51 Wails (Go) shell + Go app core + Node engine child process, migration spike (Superseded for implementation by P52)
P51 planned a migration spike moving the app off Electron onto Wails (Go) with a partial backend migration; it is superseded for implementation by P52 and never went past the plan.
In the P51 architecture, Wails/Go is the native shell and absorbs all of src/main (IPC handlers, SQLite storage, settings/layout/tabs/saved-queries/filters/connections persistence, op log, pre-connect scripts, tree service, connection state, credential encryption, logging).
In the P51 architecture, src/engine (119 files, 14,743 lines, eleven DB adapters, cache, scheduler) stays unchanged in TypeScript and runs as a plain Node.js child process spawned from Go's os/exec, as src/main/engine-host.ts forks it from Electron today.
P51 vendors a real Node runtime binary in the bundle, with the engine's .js and node_modules shipped as loose files beside it.
The user ruled out Rust/Tauri in favor of Go, and ruled out any non-Node JS runtime or single-file compilation (Bun, Deno, Electrobun's Cottontail, pkg, Node SEA, bun build --compile).
Install size is explicitly not a concern, which licenses vendoring a real Node runtime and removes the self-extract-then-dlopen packaging/hardened-runtime risk of the Tauri plan.
Backward compatibility with existing kira.sqlite rows is not required, so the Go-side storage/settings schema is defined fresh without zod-.default()-style compatibility machinery.
The motivation for the migration is docs/PERF.md §2.2's ~620MB Chromium/Electron baseline overhead against a 350MB memory budget, which no app-level lever can reach; tests/e2e/memory.spec.ts was removed rather than kept red (commit d23121e).
The P51 spike's deliverable is a written report covering the renderer-Go bridge, Go-Node engine transport, bundling/signing, engine supervision, Keychain seam, E2E testing, a real memory measurement, per-module disposition, and a go/no-go recommendation.
The Go-Node engine transport would frame the existing transport-agnostic PortRequest/PortResponse/PortEvent protocol over stdio pipes or a Unix domain socket; this is new code on both sides and the one change src/engine needs.
Incrementally migrating individual DB adapters from the Node engine to native Go is a natural future direction (the per-kind adapters/registry.ts loader map suits it) but is not designed in P51.
P51 required the user's explicit sign-off before implementation, since a spike is not exempt from CLAUDE.md's Opus-plans-then-sign-off-then-implement loop.
Wails has no first-class sidecar/external-binary mechanism (discussion #3021 is answered only with go:embed), so spawning the Node child and bundling the vendored runtime are hand-rolled.
Wails v3's default binding transport is a fetch() to a local /wails/runtime endpoint with a JSON.stringify body (a full JSON round-trip), but its runtime source exposes a setTransport() override worth investigating for bulk data.
No first-party WebDriver story surfaced for Wails; discussion #4205 suggests pointing Playwright at wails dev's localhost:34115, which is not shell-integration coverage.
The E2E decision is that the UI suite moves fully to Playwright's isolated webkit tier, permanently giving up native menu/window/lifecycle coverage, real-IPC-bridge correctness, real Keychain coverage and src/main/security.ts's navigation-lock posture.
In the Wails plan, losing the engine means reconnecting databases (engine-host.ts's existing no-auto-respawn policy), since settings/tabs/layout/op log live in the Go process.
In the Wails plan, Keychain access becomes ordinary in-process Go code replacing safeStorage, with no privileged cross-process surface.
Wails being smaller and less mature than Tauri is an accepted trade-off given the user's Go-over-Rust preference and is not relitigated by the spike.
P51 supersedes the former "P51 Tauri + Node sidecar migration spike"; P20's row and its out-of-scope verdict are unchanged.

### v1 P52-P57 Wails/Go migration, implemented
The Electron shell was replaced with a native Wails v3 (Go) shell, absorbing all of src/main into Go; src/engine (eleven DB/queue/object-store adapters in TypeScript) stays as designed.
The TypeScript engine runs as a genuine Node.js child process under a real vendored Node runtime shipped beside the app, not Electron's and not the system one.
The bundled engine runs correctly under a bare Node with no load-bearing Electron coupling.
The credential cipher is AES-256-GCM under the app's own key with a kira:v2: envelope, replacing Chromium safeStorage's AES-128-CBC; kira:v1: data is deliberately not migrated (fresh-database cutover).
The Wails build uses the bundle identifier com.kirathecat.kira-studio-shell during P52-P56, deliberately distinguishable from the Electron build for the coexistence window.
The Go storage repos layer (P53) matches the prior Drizzle-backed TypeScript repos one-for-one, and ./internal/... needs nothing but the Go toolchain.
The Go engine-host speaks the engine's stdio-framed wire protocol, replacing Electron's parentPort; stdout is the frame channel, not a log sink, so src/engine was fixed accordingly.
P54 fixed three Go concurrency bugs: a writeFrame/stdin mutex deadlock, a cmd.Wait() race with the stdout reader, and a shared channel that split push events between subscribers instead of delivering each to all.
The migration depends on a pinned-wails3-version discipline, established in P55.
P56 used a deferred-emitter/deferred-dialogs pattern for Wails' construction-order constraints, and a bridge-level argument-validation convention.
P56 switched resolveEngine() to the real bundled engine, which exposed that the renderer's engine-status logic still expected Electron's MessagePort handoff, leaving the status pill stuck on "connecting".
The renderer bridge (src/renderer/bridge/{control,port}.ts) uses Wails' generated bindings for the control plane and one named JSONStream for the data plane, replacing contextBridge/MessagePort.
JSONStream's JSON round-trip silently dropped TextColumnChunk's TypedArrays; this was fixed with reviveChunks.
bridge/stream.go forwards bulk-data bytes verbatim with no parse or copy, an architectural invariant.
The test tier was rebuilt: tests/ui/ has 36 specs against real WebKit with both wire planes mocked; tests/e2e-real/ has 2 specs against a real -tags server Go binary; tests/e2e/ was retired.
tests/electron-db/ was folded into tests/db/kafka.spec.ts, running under the vendored Node.
Retiring tests/e2e/ permanently lost MongoDB's own anchor value coverage; hardening.spec.ts and startup.spec.ts were deleted for having no Wails analogue.
A DataGrid.vue performance bug was fixed: an unmemoized v-tooltip binding rewrote every header cell's DOM attributes on every scroll tick.
Go tests were cut from 60 to 23 files under a stricter bar of advanced/complex/deeply-nested logic only, now written into the testing conventions.
M6 deleted src/main/, src/preload/ and src/engine/index.ts; M7 removed Electron from the build, including electron.vite.config.ts, electron-builder.yml and scripts/native-electron-build.sh.
The shipping bundle identity must be set in CFBundleExecutable and in AppProcessSet's process-matching needle, in addition to other places; sign-bundle.sh and verify-packaging.sh were rewritten for the real Wails bundle layout.
The Go↔Node engine stdio protocol forces JSON.stringify of bulk typed-array data, causing a measured memory/CPU regression versus Electron: roughly 11x text inflation and 48x transient heap inflation for a 100KB chunk; not fixed in P57.
AppProcessSet scanned the whole system process table once per search needle instead of once per measurement tick; this Go performance bug was fixed.
Open items going into P58/P59: the Kafka native-module packaging gap, dead KiraApi/AppInfo interfaces in src/shared/protocol/ipc.ts (the one remaining non-comment "electron" reference in src/), and CI workflow files pending a workflow-scoped push.

### v1 P58 DB adapters in Go, Node engine sidecar removed
P58 migrated the DB adapters from the Node engine sidecar (src/engine) to native Go, called in-process, and removed the Node engine subprocess, vendored Node runtime and stdio/JSON transport entirely.
P58 had six sub-phases: P58a (Go substrate + Postgres, checkpoint C1), P58b (MySQL/MariaDB/SQLite/ClickHouse), P58c (MongoDB/Redis), P58d (SQS/S3), P58e (Kafka, checkpoint C2), P58f (cutover deleting src/engine, enginehost and the vendored Node runtime).
The parent plan for P58 is docs/v1/plans/P58-go-native-adapters.md, amended in place per sub-phase findings; CLAUDE.md holds per-sub-phase implementation findings.
The P58 Deliverable column was left as originally written per the folder's never-retro-edit rule (docs/v1/README.md), though it omits sqlite and wrongly lists rabbitmq.
sqlite migrated to native Go in P58b, and rabbitmq was never migrated because it had already been dropped as a supported connection kind before P58.
The ten kinds migrated to native Go are postgres, mariadb, mysql, sqlite, clickhouse, mongodb, redis, kafka, sqs and s3; nativeKinds reached ten of ten at P58e's M9.3 commit.
Go driver choices: pgx/v5 (postgres), go-sql-driver/mysql (mariadb/mysql), modernc.org/sqlite (sqlite), hand-rolled net/http client (clickhouse), mongo-driver/v2, go-redis/v9, franz-go+kadm (kafka), aws-sdk-go-v2 (sqs/s3).
modernc.org/sqlite is pure Go with no cgo and is also used for the app's own storage layer, closing the last cgo dependency in the product's own code.
Checkpoint C1 (after P58a M5) proved one native Postgres connection served end to end while the Node child still served the other nine kinds.
Checkpoint C2 (before P58f M10) proved all ten kinds passed a full manual pass with the Node child spawned but idle, confirmed by a request-scoped warning counter reading zero.
The migration loses MySQL's allowPublicKeyRetrieval, because go-sql-driver/mysql has no equivalent, a narrow security-posture loss.
Native migration gains: Kafka regains DescribeConfigs/DescribeCluster (lost since P32), SQLite gets real server-side cancellation, MongoDB document view keeps the on-disk type tag of whole-number doubles, and a packaged build can connect to Kafka for the first time.
P58f M10 deleted src/engine (110 files, 13,637 lines), enginehost, enginetest, the vendored Node runtime, scripts/vendor-node.sh and all packaging steps referencing them.
tests/db/ survives as a shared fixture corpus rather than a spec suite.
The backend half of tests/ipc/ moved to a Go fixture generator (shell/internal/ipcfixture) that still writes the same *.fixture.ts modules read by frontend specs, preserving the anti-drift guarantee.
The Kafka native-module packaging gap left by P57 was closed in P58e, then became moot once P58f deleted the Node engine.
<!-- /chapter v1 -->

<!-- chapter v1.1 -->
## v1.1
Source: docs/v1.1/ at bd0c224688d9. 22 phases.
v1 shipped, with its spec at docs/v1/SPEC.md, closed out through P58.
The v1.1 folder uses a fresh phase numbering (P1, P2, …) instead of continuing v1's, because v1's numbering was specific to that spec's scope.
Real-bridge tests use the tests/e2e-real arrangement, driven by injected JS rather than Playwright, so the renderer is a genuine WKWebView rather than Chromium.
DataGrid.vue and columns.ts were reverted to the pre-P47 hand-rolled rowRange/colRange.
P22 D5, on F8–F11, declined embedder-level configuration of Wails v3.0.0-beta.16 and declined the one reachable escape hatch (NativeWindow() into Wails' private ObjC class).

### v1.1 P1 Cutover closeout + dependency/script/folder audit
The P58f cutover deleted src/engine, enginehost and the vendored Node runtime; it was implemented under the P58 row of docs/v1/SPEC.md before the v1.1 chapter opened.
v1.1 P1 audits every dependency (package.json, shell/go.mod) and every script (scripts/*, the scripts block in package.json) against what the post-cutover tree uses, and removes anything stale.
tsgo no longer does anything meaningful now that the toolchain has moved on, so v1.1 P1 removes it.
The repository is now a single Go backend plus a single Vue frontend, replacing the old two-backend/two-framework (Electron+Node engine) shape. v1.1 P1 removes or folds in stale folders and structural constructs left from that shape.
v1.1 P1 sweeps for dead weight beyond what P58f touched, because starting the new chapter on a clean baseline is cheaper than carrying stale tooling or an outdated folder layout into every later phase.
v1.1 phases are numbered from P1 again rather than continuing v1's numbering.

### v1.1 P2 Code review, three rounds
The v1.1 P2 code review follows the CLAUDE.md code-review process: three parallel Opus subagents (architecture/structure/maintainability/security; functional correctness/business logic; performance/resource efficiency) report findings only, and Sonnet fixes every finding.
The v1.1 P2 review runs three full rounds against the tree as it stands after P1; each round starts from what the previous round's fixes actually changed.
P2 is a hardening pass over the Wails/Go rewrite and the P1 cleanup, done before building further on top of it.
P2 uses three review rounds instead of v1's five, because P1 already narrows the tree the review runs against.

### v1.1 P3 Folder structure, scripts, and dependency-tooling cleanup
The v1.1 P3 phase restructures the repo folder layout to match a standard Wails app, leaving room to grow into a monorepo hosting more Wails apps plus parts shared between their backends and frontends.
P3 checks whether tests/db/, the shared DB fixture corpus that docs/ARCHITECTURE.md's Testing section calls not a suite of its own, is still in the right place under a monorepo-shaped tree.
bun run dev is broken because shell/build/Taskfile.yml's stock Wails scaffold defaults PACKAGE_MANAGER to npm and its dev:frontend and install:frontend:deps tasks run inside shell/frontend, which has no package.json.
The real frontend lives at the repo root rather than in shell/frontend.
Dependency installation is inconsistent between npm and bun across the Taskfiles and scripts; P3 standardizes it on bun.
P3 audits and fixes every dev/build/install script, and removes or folds in folders and files that no longer serve a purpose under the new layout.
The repo's folder shape drifted through several structural rewrites (Electron+Node engine to Wails+Go) without a dedicated pass; P3 is done right after P2 because restructuring before more feature work is cheaper than restructuring twice.

### v1.1 P4 FE↔BE data transfer protocol
The renderer and the Go backend exchange data through the hand-built adapterhost/bridge streaming frame protocol over Wails' in-process bridge; it was designed for one process pair on one machine.
The frontend and backend may later be split and communicate over a real network instead of Wails' in-process bridge, so the protocol should be efficient and network-portable.
The team decided to settle the efficient, network-portable protocol shape now, because discovering a needed redesign after more code depends on single-machine assumptions costs more.
A standardized transport/serialization protocol (e.g. gRPC, HTTP/2+protobuf) should be adopted over the hand-built framing if it is genuinely a better fit; keeping the hand-built approach is not the default.

### v1.1 P5 RAM usage
The v1.1 P5 task is a RAM usage audit: find where the app's own RAM usage can be reduced and fix what is found.
For the v1.1 P5 RAM audit, the frontend (Vue/WebView side) is the main place to look for improvement, not the Go backend.
docs/PERF.md records a real, measured memory story, but the app has never had a dedicated sweep for RAM used unnecessarily.

### v1.1 P6 Vue Vapor mode
v1.1 phase P6 evaluates Vue's Vapor mode (compiled, no-virtual-DOM rendering) against the app's own component tree and adopts it wherever it genuinely helps.
Vapor mode is evaluated after the backend rewrite became stable, because its tradeoffs differ from the rendering the app was built against and the team wants a real evaluation, not an unexamined assumption either way.

### v1.1 P7 CPU/memory status readout
The app's CPU/memory status-bar readout lives in internal/metrics; it is suspected to be inefficient and incorrect, with CPU reading far higher than expected.
The app is Mac-first; Activity Monitor's approach to process CPU/memory accounting is the reference model for the status-bar readout.
Users report they do not trust the status bar's CPU/memory numbers, on the one platform the app ships on.

### v1.1 P8 Multi-window correctness
The app must work correctly with two or more windows open at once; multi-window is a real usage pattern to support cleanly, not an edge case.

### v1.1 P9 Row coloring settings
A settings toggle lets users disable the data grid's row coloring; when off, every row renders white/plain.
The data grid no longer applies a distinct color to string-typed cell values; strings render in the plain text color like every other type.

### v1.1 P10 Ship the app as a DMG (Done)
The Taskfile tasks darwin:package:dmg and create:dmg in apps/kira-studio/build/darwin/Taskfile.yml parameterize the background image, volume icon, file icon, and window sizing.
P10 wires darwin:package:dmg/create:dmg into package.json's packaging script and the release workflow so they produce a real, signed .dmg, replacing the zipped .app.
The DMG was deferred from P4 as a deliberate scope decision, not a missing capability; the Taskfile pipeline existed and worked but was never wired into what ships.

### v1.1 P11 FlatBuffers data-plane wire format (Done)
The data plane's responses and events use a FlatBuffers binary frame instead of the JSON+base64 envelope; requests stay JSON text.
The FlatBuffers frame is file-identified with "KIF1"; its [uint] offset/truncated vectors are decoded as typed-array views over the received bytes (zero-copy).
P11 re-measured the P4 F10 fixtures on the new codec and recorded the result in docs/PERF.md.
P4 declined a binary envelope until a stated bar was cleared; P11 reversed this because FlatBuffers cleared it: 2.7 KB gzip bundle, near-zero wire overhead at real page sizes, and the whole frontend decode pass disappearing.
FlatBuffers superseded P4's own proposal of a hand-built binary envelope, which was not built.

### v1.1 P12 Code review, round three
P12 (v1.1) is the third CLAUDE.md-process code review round, originally scoped as part of P2, using the same three-subagent structure and run against the tree after P3-P10 land, with findings fixed the same way.
P12 runs as two iterations per CLAUDE.md's multiple-passes rule: each iteration gets its own plan-doc file, and the second runs against what the first iteration's fixes changed, not batched into one pass. The second catches what the first round's fixes introduce.
P2 was capped at two rounds so the third round (P12) could catch whatever P3-P10's work introduces, rather than reviewing code that further substantial work would immediately change.

### v1.1 P13 Query console format button
Phase v1.1 P13 adds a Format button to every query console: each SQL dialect's console (Postgres, MySQL/MariaDB, SQLite, ClickHouse) and any non-SQL query/command surface the adapters expose (Mongo, Redis, Kafka, etc.). It reformats the query in place with a real formatter.

### v1.1 P14 Confirm-before-reveal for saved credentials
Show a confirmation step before revealing a saved password or secret (e.g. in a connection's edit form); never display it immediately.
Prefer the operating system's own authentication prompt (macOS LocalAuthentication: Touch ID / system password) over a bespoke in-app modal to confirm revealing a saved secret, because the app is Mac-first.
Use an in-app confirmation to reveal a saved secret only where OS-level auth genuinely isn't a good fit.

### v1.1 P15 Fake data generator
Planned feature v1.1 P15 (fake data generator): integrate a Faker-style fake-data library and a UI to generate a user-specified number of realistic fake rows into the currently viewed table/collection, respecting column types/schema wherever the connection's adapter exposes them.
No fake data generation capability exists in the current tree.

### v1.1 P16 DB adapter min/max version compatibility suite
For each database/queue adapter, the oldest and newest server version its Go client library actually supports must be determined.
An on-demand compatibility suite runs each adapter's existing conformance tests against both the oldest and newest supported server image for its kind, instead of one pinned version; it is not part of the regular CI/test run.
The connection-add UI must show a note per connection kind stating its minimum supported server version.
Developing against one pinned test-fixture server version never catches version-boundary bugs, which is why the min/max version suite is built.

### v1.1 P17 Settings panel apply-on-save, with revert-to-default
The settings panel is to be reworked so changes are staged locally and only take effect when the user clicks Save, instead of applying live as each control changes. Live-apply was reported as confusing.
The settings panel is to get a "Revert to Defaults" button that resets every setting to its default value.

### v1.1 P18 SQL language server, EXPLAIN analysis, and auto-explain
The SQL language server provides conventional language-server features (completions, diagnostics, hovers) for the SQL dialects the app supports.
The SQL language server is driven purely by user-supplied DDL, with no live database connection and no schema introspection over a real connection.
An Explain button runs the database's own EXPLAIN (or dialect equivalent) on the current query, parses the output, and presents it readably, calling out issues such as missing indexes, full scans and expensive operations rather than a raw plan dump.
A configurable threshold defines an expensive query; it flags an Explain result and decides when auto-explain surfaces a warning.
Each connection's edit form has a toggle to enable auto-explain, which automatically runs Explain on every SELECT query issued on that connection.

### v1.1 P19 Dependency and runtime version bump
Phase P19 bumps every tracked dependency to the latest stable release: root package.json and workspace packages, shell/go.mod, the Go toolchain version, pinned Node/Bun runtime versions, and any other pinned toolchain version.
P19 includes fixing whatever the bump breaks: compile errors, failing tests, deprecated APIs, and config-format changes the new versions expect.
P19 is scheduled after P5-P10's feature and perf work is stable, because bumping earlier would mean chasing a moving target while that work is still landing.
P19 is scheduled before P12's review rounds and P21's docs sweep so both run against the final, up-to-date dependency set rather than one about to go stale.

### v1.1 P20 Scripts and dev/package workflow overhaul, second pass
Phase v1.1 P20 is a full audit and cleanup of every dev/build/install/package script in the repo: scripts/*, every Taskfile (apps/kira-studio/build/*/Taskfile.yml and others), and the scripts block of package.json.
P20 targets bun run dev not working, packaging not working, and something not regenerated correctly; the Wails bindings-generation step is the prime suspect after P19's Go/toolchain bump.
A Wails bindings regeneration with wrong flags can silently break the tree underneath it, as shown in P3's history.
P20 must collapse duplicated script logic into a single shared implementation; git config is invoked roughly three times across what should be one script.
P20 is a second pass of P3's script discipline because P13-P19 kept touching scripts (including P16's new scripts/db-compat.sh and P19's toolchain bump) with no dedicated pass over the area.
P20 must land after P19, because P19's dependency/toolchain bump likely causes the breakage (stale bindings-generation step, toolchain-version mismatch) and fixing scripts earlier would target a moving target.
P20 must land before P21's closing docs sweep so P21 can document a dev/package workflow that works.

### v1.1 P21 Docs refresh
Phase P21 is the v1.1 chapter's closing docs-refresh phase, modeled on v1's docs/v1/plans/P14-docs.md, because documentation drift compounds with every phase that lands without a dedicated pass.
P21 sweeps docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/PERF.md, docs/PACKAGING.md, README.md, CLAUDE.md's "Known open items", and any other doc that docs/v1/README.md's discipline points at, for drift against the tree after P1-P20.
P21 fixes outdated architecture descriptions, superseded perf numbers, packaging steps that P10 changed, and version and dependency mentions that P19 superseded.

### v1.1 P22 WebView scroll performance
The data grid's fast-scroll rendering lag (rows take a moment to catch up) has had no prior investigation in this repo and needs root-cause work, likely in the virtualizer's overscan/windowing, paint scheduling, or how fast the rendered row window catches up at high scroll velocity.
docs/v1.1/WEBVIEW-SCROLL-MEMORY.md investigated WKWebView memory growth during sustained scroll on real macOS hardware and concluded there is no frontend-code fix; the growth is WebKit's own CoreAnimation tile-pooling behavior.
The WKWebView memory investigation ruled out the virtualizer, CSS containment, sticky positioning, painted content width, and scroller architecture as causes.
Do not re-test contain: layout, sticky-to-absolute conversions, @tanstack/vue-virtual swaps, top/left vs transform, or painted-content-width for WKWebView scroll memory, because they were already measured and ruled out on real hardware.
Measure WKWebView memory with proc_pid_rusage, not vmmap.
The two untried avenues for the WKWebView memory problem are embedder-level WKWebViewConfiguration/WKPreferences tuning (needs Go/Wails-shell-side work; unknown whether Wails v3 exposes a usable surface) and reducing the default window size.
The default window size is hardcoded to 1280×800 in apps/kira-studio/internal/shell/window.go, and the memory doc measured window size as directly scaling the memory cost.
<!-- /chapter v1.1 -->

<!-- chapter v1.2 -->
## v1.2
Source: docs/v1.2/ at bd0c224688d9. 30 phases.
The v1.2 folder uses a fresh phase numbering (P1, P2, …) rather than continuing v1.1's, because v1.1's numbering was specific to that spec's scope.
The Adapter interface gained SchemaColumns, with model.RelationColumns/ValidateRelationColumns and the Caps.SchemaColumns flag; the flag is true for the five SQL kinds and false for mongo/redis/kafka/sqs/s3, which return adapters.Unsupported.
Each SQL adapter's listSchemaColumns is a widened form of its existing per-object column query (schema-wide WHERE, no relname/TABLE_NAME filter), never a loop over relations.
Postgres and mysqlfamily fold IsPrimaryKey into the schema-columns query; sqlite reuses relevantTables plus one pragma_table_xinfo join; clickhouse uses one schema-wide system.columns query with IsPrimaryKey always false per its D18/D23 rule.
tree.Service.SchemaColumns uses a fourth metadata_cache kind (columns) that shares the container's existing (connection_id, path) row instead of one row per relation, to respect F8's 200-row budget; it is cache-aside with requireConnected after the cache check, like Children/Describe/Definition.
The frontend state/schemaColumns.ts ensureSchemaColumns is idempotent, single-flight and fire-and-forget; it is wired into ConsoleView.vue on mount and container-path change, and invalidated by the onConnectionMetadataInvalidated broadcast.
SQL completion source precedence is document DDL (wins wholesale), then cached schema columns, then tree relations, then undefined; there is never a per-table merge.
effectiveSchema (state/schemaColumns.ts) is the DdlSchema-shaped projection that lint and hover read via ConsoleView.vue's ddlSchema computed, so completion, diagnostics and hover cannot disagree about what the console knows.
P19 D15's "Fill from connection" button and D16's no-schema hint strip were deleted; the Schema (DDL) dialog, saveDdl/ensureDdl/parseDdl and the connection-row menu entry remain, now as a deliberate override rather than the only schema supply.
mongoFilterCandidates/mongoSortCandidates live in views/shared/mongoFieldSample.ts because views/console/** may not import views/documents/**.
The Mongo console offers a fourth completion position: a bare identifier inside a db.<collection>.<method>(…) call offers that collection's sampled field names, merged with the BSON-constructor list; DocumentView.vue pushes the sample on page load and the console only reads it, never fetches.
docs/ARCHITECTURE.md's Caching section records the fourth metadata_cache kind and hands two open items to P24.
P22c deliberately has no staleness/TTL policy for the columns cache kind (P24's question), no cross-schema completion (OQ-3), and no indexes/foreign keys in the SchemaColumns payload (OQ-2).
Per-adapter SchemaColumns conformance tests assert DataType/IsPrimaryKey byte-identical to Describe's answer for the same column, run against real containers for postgres/mariadb/mysql/sqlite/clickhouse.

### v1.2 P1 Shared UI shell: title bar, left panel, and tab/content area, modularized
v1.2 P1 builds a custom title bar, using the app background color rather than OS chrome, that hosts the two top-level mode tabs, Studio and Http.
v1.2 P1 generalizes Studio's left-hand tree panel and bottom tabbed content area into components parameterized by what they show, so a collections tree left panel and HTTP request/response tabs can use the same panel and tab-strip machinery.
The shared-shell refactor must not change Studio's own behavior.
v1.2 P1 adds no new user-facing HTTP functionality; it is purely structural work every later phase depends on.
The shared shell is built first, before HTTP-specific features, because most of Http mode's chrome already exists in Studio; building it twice would mean two panel implementations and two places for the same bug. Later phases build on the real shared shell, not a placeholder.

### v1.2 P2 HTTP request/response core
v1.2 P2 delivers the minimum viable Http tab: a request builder (method, URL, query params, headers, body) that sends real HTTP requests.
The Http tab response viewer shows status, headers and body, with JSON syntax highlighting, a beautify action, and status-code hint text alongside the status.
v1.2 P2 is the smallest end-to-end slice of the Http feature (request in, response out, readable); later phases add capability on top of this working core rather than building toward one.

### v1.2 P3 Request body payload formats
The request body editor has modes: raw (plain text only), code (JavaScript/JSON/HTML/XML, syntax-highlighted, JSON/XML beautifiable), x-www-form-urlencoded, form-data (including real file fields), and binary (one local file as the whole body).
GraphQL body support shipped initially for Postman parity but was later removed outright, not deprecated.
Raw's five-language sub-selector was split into plain-text raw and a new top-level code mode, so body modes no longer map 1:1 onto Postman's body.mode.
P4 must build a real translation between the app's body modes and Postman's body.mode at the collection import/export boundary.
Payload formats (P3) were sequenced right after the core rather than folded into P2, because collections (P4) and curl generation (P5) must serialize/parse the full payload-format model, and getting it right first avoids revisiting their serialization.

### v1.2 P4 Collections: SQLite storage, real Postman-format import/export, left-panel tree
Collections are stored in the app's existing SQLite database (kira.sqlite, which also holds connections, tabs and settings), not as loose Postman-format files on disk. The internal representation (normalized folder/request schema, serialized JSON column, or a mix) is left to the phase's plan.
SQLite was chosen for collections because it matches how all other app state persists, adds no new storage paradigm and avoids a premature filesystem-sync problem; Postman fidelity is a property of conversion at the import/export boundary, not of the storage engine.
P4 has no git-based or edit-the-file-directly workflow: no filesystem watching and no external-edit detection; this is explicitly deferred.
Import must read a real Postman Collection v2.1 JSON file and reproduce its structure faithfully in SQLite.
Export must write a real, valid Postman Collection v2.1 JSON file from the stored data, so collections round-trip through the app.
Collections are shown in the left panel as a folder/request tree, built on P1's modularized panel.
Collections are the organizing structure for history, curl and the timeline, which all operate on a saved request, so a request needs a place to live first.
The body mode vocabulary is this app's own rather than Postman's body.mode verbatim.

### v1.2 P5 Collection variables and environments
Collection variables are scoped to a collection; environments are separate named, switchable sets of variables layered on top of collection variables.
Variables and environments resolve via {{name}} substitution wherever a request references one, including URL, headers and body.
Each variable or environment entry can be marked a secret with a checkbox; a secret's value is masked inline in the list and shown only after a system authentication prompt.
Secret reveal reuses the existing v1.1 P14 fingerprint/Touch ID reveal mechanism instead of rebuilding it.
Both variables and environments keep a history of prior values, not just the current one, and both support reordering.
P5 is sequenced right after collections (P4) because collection variables are scoped to a collection and need one to exist.
P5 is sequenced before curl generation (now P7) because a generated curl command must substitute real values for any {{variable}} reference to be runnable.
P5 is sequenced before response history, the raw inspector and the timeline, because none of those are meaningful until requests can use variables.

### v1.2 P6 Faker-backed dynamic values
v1.2 P6 adds Faker-backed dynamic values in requests: a {{$...}} variable form (random name, email, UUID, timestamp, and so on), in the style of Postman/Bruno.
Dynamic {{$...}} values are resolved via @faker-js/faker fresh on every send, not stored.
@faker-js/faker is already a dependency, adopted in v1.1's P15 fake-data-generator phase.
P6 follows P5 because it extends P5's {{...}} substitution engine, resolving a generator function in place of a stored variable, so no second substitution mechanism is needed.

### v1.2 P7 curl parse and generate
v1.2 P7 lets a user paste a curl command to populate a request (method, URL, headers, body, auth).
v1.2 P7 generates an equivalent curl command from the current request's state.
In generated curl commands, any {{variable}} or {{$dynamic}} reference is resolved to its real value, because curl has no notion of either.
P7 (curl parse and generate) depends on P3's full payload-format model, because curl's -d/--data/-F flags map onto exactly those body modes.
P7 depends on the P5/P6 substitution engine existing, so a generated curl command is runnable as-is.
P7 benefits from P4 existing, because a parsed curl command is naturally saved into a collection.

### v1.2 P8 Response history
Response history (v1.2 P8) persists past responses per request, not just the most recent; they are browsable and comparable against each other.
A response history entry is a saved snapshot of exactly what P2's response viewer renders.
Response history is sequenced after the core response viewer and after collections exist, because history is scoped per saved request.

### v1.2 P9 Raw request/response inspector and raw request editor
v1.2 P9 is a raw request/response inspector and raw request editor: it shows the exact bytes sent and received, not the structured/parsed model P2's builder presents, and lets users author and edit a request at the raw level.
v1.2 P9 is an advanced-debugging capability on top of the structured request/response model established by P2-P3.
v1.2 P9 needs a real request/response cycle to inspect, so it is sequenced after the core rather than before it.

### v1.2 P10 Request timeline
The request timeline shows the full chronological sequence of everything that happened while a request ran, not only the final response's own timing.
In the request timeline, each redirect hop is its own step with its own detail (method, URL, status, response headers), not folded into a single number.
Within each hop, the timeline shows the phase breakdown (DNS resolution, connection, TLS handshake, wait/TTFB, content download) rather than one elapsed-time figure. A reused connection is shown as reused, not as an instant/zero one.
Phase data comes from net/http/httptrace.ClientTrace callbacks hooked on the request's context, the standard low-risk mechanism, rather than a parser or protocol implementation of our own.
Go's built-in redirect-following client reuses the original request's context across every hop, so one httptrace installed up front fires once per hop.
internal/httpclient/client.go's existing checkRedirect/[]RedirectHop context-threading, added for P2/P3's redirect-count/final-URL reporting, is the bucketing technique P10 extends with per-hop timing at each checkRedirect call boundary.
P10 needs real instrumentation of the HTTP client's own request lifecycle, which only exists once P2's core request path is built.
P10 is sequenced after the raw inspector because both surface detail about the same underlying request execution.

### v1.2 P11 gRPC support
The v1.2 P11 phase adds gRPC support: browsing services and methods (via reflection or a supplied .proto file) and issuing unary and streaming gRPC calls, hosted through the same shell.
gRPC is the one non-HTTP protocol in scope for this chapter; WebSocket was dropped.
gRPC support is sequenced last among the feature phases so it lands on a shell and request/response/variables/history/timeline model already proven by every earlier phase.

### v1.2 P12 Studio/Http(→Api) modularization & separability audit
Phase P12 (v1.2) is a structural pass on the Studio/Http boundary, not a feature phase: no new user-facing behavior beyond the Http → Api rename.
P12 extracts the Api-facing frontend code into its own genuine Bun workspace package(s) (e.g. packages/api-core, packages/api-ui), not a tidier directory inside apps/kira-studio; exact naming and split are left to P12's plan.
The root workspaces config gains packages/* in P12.
The package split (rather than a directory-only move) follows v1.3's Git module precedent, so the two modules end up structurally consistent.
P12 splits any test file that grew to cover both modules' cases into one file per module, folder-separated, even where the runner command still runs both suites together.
P12 audits internal/bridge and the remaining Go side for coupling that would block splitting Http into a standalone app later.
P12 renames the module Http → Api in user-facing text (the mode tab and other text naming the mode) and in code wherever an identifier, file or directory names the module rather than the HTTP protocol.
internal/httpclient and other genuinely protocol-shaped names are not renamed in P12.
The rename to Api is done because gRPC (P11) makes the mode more than an HTTP client, and it goes in the same pass because it touches the same files the separability audit is already moving.
P12 is the phase every other phase should minimize work for; doing the separation once, deliberately, after the module is feature-complete is cheaper than enforcing perfect separation through ten prior phases or leaving the coupling indefinitely.

### v1.2 P13 Api module UI check and improvement
P13 is a UI check and improvement pass over every Api-mode surface (request builder, response viewer, collections tree, dialogs, empty/error states), checked against the app's design system rather than each earlier phase's ad hoc styling.
The design system reference for P13 is docs/design/kira-design-system, primitives.css, and the shared token scale.
P13 makes Api mode consistent with Studio mode's spacing, type, color and icon conventions, and tightens it to be dense enough for a power tool, not sparse for its own sake.
P13 cleans up leftover placeholder or rough-edge styling from earlier phases.
P13 adds no new functionality; it is a visual/interaction-consistency pass, not a feature phase.
P13 is sequenced after modularization and the rename (P12) so it polishes the module under its final name and directory shape rather than styling files P12 would move.
P13 is sequenced before the code review (P14) so the review reads the UI in its finished, polished state rather than styling about to change again.

### v1.2 P14 Api module code review (2 rounds)
v1.2 P14 is two rounds of dedicated code review scoped to the Api module only (renamed from Http in P12): its separated directories plus its facing halves of internal/httpclient, internal/postman, and internal/bridge.
The P14 Api module review applies the same discipline as v1.1's P12 chapter-wide review (docs/v1.1/SPEC.md), focused on this chapter's own module.
P14 is sequenced last, after modularization, the rename, and the UI pass, so the review sees the module under its final name and final separated, polished shape, not code P12/P13 would move, rename, or restyle.

### v1.2 P15 (new) Request builder UX pass — part 1: layout, primitives and body mode
P15 part 1 is the presentation half of the request builder UX pass, covering eight of twelve user-reported items; the editor-behaviour half is P15b.
The response panel (chrome and pane switcher included) is present from the moment a request tab opens, not only after a first send.
A status code's meaning is shown on its own always-visible line, not a truncatable caption plus a hover.
The Studio/Api mode-switch buttons are sized up to the app's own tab metrics and now render the icon that modes.ts has declared unused since P1.
The .p-input class is inline-flex, so a TextField is about 20 characters wide wherever placed unless its call site says otherwise; this is the root cause of both the narrow table fields and the URL field never growing.
A new shared Checkbox primitive matching the app's design system replaces all fourteen raw input type=checkbox call sites app-wide, Studio included (nine are in Studio). It is shared app-wide because primitives already live in the shared theme layer; AppButton, TextField and SegmentedControl are precedent.
JSON is promoted to its own top-level body mode as a UI-level promotion over unchanged code+codeLanguage storage, not a new wire/Go/Postman vocabulary and not a data migration.
A request's tab shows a body-present indicator via a new optional badge() member on the tab-kind registry, which answers what P4 D15 declined.
The toolbar is reflowed so Save sits with the request's name in the view head and the URL field takes the row.
P15 is sequenced after P12/P13 so it refines a surface already settled into its final module shape and design-system pass, not files about to be renamed or restyled.
P15 is split from P15b because the halves fail differently, P15b opens with a packages/api-core foundation commit unrelated to these eight fixes, and this half touches Studio (nine checkbox call sites and the title bar), so one review pass carries that risk.
The plan for P15 is in plans/P15-request-builder-ux.md.

### v1.2 P15b Request builder UX pass — part 2: input and editor behaviour
v1.2 P15b request builder UX pass part 2 changes land in three files: AutocompleteField.vue, CodeMirrorHost.vue and FieldRowsTable.vue.
P15b covers four items: header-name autocomplete over a curated well-known request-header vocabulary; {{variable}} colouring (resolved / secret-deferred / unresolved) with hover and variable-name autocomplete in URL, header values and body editor; auto-closing bracket/quote pairs; arrow-key navigation across row-based request tables.
The {{variable}} hover shows the resolved value but never a secret's value.
A secret's plaintext deliberately never reaches the renderer.
The {{variable}} work extends AutocompleteField.vue's overlay approach (a real native input with a read-only CodeMirror painted behind it) rather than replacing the fields with editors, because page.fill() across five spec files depends on them staying real inputs.
CodeMirrorHost gains one rangeHighlights seam for colour that comes from data rather than from a grammar.
The variable hover uses a field-local panel on theme/floatingPosition.ts's existing pointReference, because the overlay is pointer-events: none and the app's tooltip singleton anchors per element, not per token.
Resolved variable values need no new pipeline: mergedValuesAndSecrets and resolve already run per keystroke for the unresolved-count chip.
Auto-close brackets/quotes is enabled only in the request body editor and the plain fields, because editor/wrapSelection.ts declines closeBrackets() due to the console's unterminated-string lint.
P15b is implemented: all seven commits (N1-N7) landed on claude/feature-v1-2, and the plan plans/P15b-request-builder-editor-behavior.md is fully checked off.

### v1.2 P16 (new) SQL grid polish, cross-cutting dropdown/input consistency, and Api search
P16 SQL grid work (pager/nav arrows repositioned, per-column minimum width, consistent overscroll) is Studio-only; dropdown closed-state height and input padding/contrast fixes are cross-cutting design-system changes for Studio and Api.
P16 adds a search affordance to the Api request/response viewer and to the module's other list-shaped surfaces (headers, variables, and similar).
The P16 pager moves into ViewChrome's existing #toolbar-end group, last after the pending-changes controls, rather than a new slot; the RunState reflow that would jitter it is fixed at the primitive.
The SQL grid per-column minimum width is header-aware, not a raised flat floor, because the header cell spends 42-58px on padding, the 14px sort control and an optional PK/FK badge that no width computation accounted for.
The SQL grid disables overscroll with overscroll-behavior: none on every .slick-viewport, because only 'disabled' is expressible in CSS; this deliberately re-opens the earlier reverted 'disable overscroll entirely' instruction, and a one-word revert path is recorded.
The P16 plan is in plans/P16-sql-grid-consistency-search.md; it was sequenced after P15 by the one-phase-at-a-time discipline, not because it depends on P15's output.
P16 was implemented in sixteen commits (Q1-Q16) plus a follow-up correcting a header-chrome constant that was 8px short, caught by the new D4 case in tests/ui.

### v1.2 P17 (new) Variable/environment management overhaul, Faker scoping, and value pipes
P17 scope: method select restyled and colour-coded per HTTP method; Description field on variable/environment entries; editing a variable set or environment opens as its own tab; environments can be cloned.
P17 adds a bulk-edit mode for variables and environments via a .env-format text editor (KEY=VALUE lines), applied as a diff against the existing set through a parse/serialize/reconcile design.
P17 adds a single panel, reachable from any request tab, showing the active environment's and the collection's variables together instead of two separate dialogs.
substitute.ts's doc comment states "no expression language" as a deliberate design choice (D1/D17); P5 secret masking, P6 per-occurrence dynamic-value freshness and P9/P10/P14 masking fixes rely on substitution staying a simple one-pass find-{{-find-}} scan. Pipes deliberately reopen this decision.
Pipes reopen only the name read (text.slice(open+2, close).trim()), not the {{/}} scan. Parsing is all-or-nothing: every segment after the first must be a known transform, else the whole text is the name, so existing inputs are unaffected.
The pinned Go/TS substitution corpus passing unedited is the guard that the pipe grammar change is inert for existing inputs.
apivars.Resolver records the exact text it wrote per distinct (name, pipeline) pair, not name → plaintext, so secretReplacer masks base64/upper/URL-encoded forms, one entry per spelling; a request using both {{secret}} and {{secret | base64}} masks both.
The rendered form reaches the resolver through a callback (onResolved) rather than a field on Reference, because Reference is a struct whose purpose is to be reported.
Resolver.Used() returns UsedSecret{Name, Rendered, Placeholder} fed by an onResolved callback, and every rendered/piped form is masked via a length-sorted strings.Replacer.
A transformed secret (e.g. base64-encoded) is as sensitive as its plaintext, so masking must register the transformed form; omitting it reopens the encoded-secret gap found in P14 round 2.
A pipe applies after per-occurrence dynamic-value generation, leaving P6 D3 freshness and D7 short-circuit untouched.
Initial pipe transforms are base64 encode/decode, upper/lower case, and URL encode/decode, usable on variables, environments and dynamic values.
Faker re-scoping is additive with no migration: fake.<faker module>.<method> (vocabulary from Studio's fakeData/recipes.ts) sits beside Postman's $name spellings, which stay as the Postman import/export contract. The Faker catalogue also gains autocomplete.
Tests tests/ui/http-pipes.spec.ts cover: a piped secret never resolves client-side; the Raw pane, Timeline hop and persisted history entry show the masked reference; both spellings of one secret mask as one distinct secret.
P17 is implemented in commits R1-R14 on claude/feature-v1-2, with the plan in plans/P17-variable-environment-overhaul.md.

### v1.2 P18 (new) History correctness, retention, gRPC parity, mode-button alignment, and environment colour
The history store is api/state/history.ts (P12 D12's shared factory createHistoryStore), not in packages/api-core.
Stale history list root cause: createHistoryStore's lazy branch set stale but nothing read it, so a send with the History pane closed left the list frozen. Fix: ensureLoaded became ensureFresh with stale as a second precondition, and ensure() always returns the reactive proxy.
History retention was capped at 20 per scope since P8 D6/P11 D11 in both tables; P18 raised both caps to 30 (HISTORY_PER_SCOPE_LIMIT and GRPC_HISTORY_PER_SCOPE_LIMIT), oldest evicted first, pinned equal to the Go constants by a parity test.
A truncated history list shows the note "only the last 30 are kept" at the bottom.
gRPC history stored its request message with no per-entry cap, which broke the invariant its global byte sweep depends on (one oversized message emptied grpc_call_history). P18 gave the request message a 256 KiB cap, proven by a Go test.
Response bodies in history are persisted up to maxHistoryBodyBytes in internal/storage/repos/response_history.go.
HTTP history stored the request and its truncation flag but nothing rendered either; RawExchangePane.vue now reads them, reconstructing both documents from the four stage-1 fields of a snapshot via the generateRawRequestFromStored adapter, with no new storage.
gRPC request view parity (GrpcRequestView.vue) added {{variable}} colouring/hover/completion (variableCompletion.ts moved to api/state/), a grpc-timeout-style metadata vocabulary, a response pane that is a panel from tab-open, grpcCodeHint() giving non-OK codes their own meaning line, and Save/target field in P15 D7/D4's shape.
The Studio/Api mode tab icon is boxed and its text labelled (workbench/TitleBar.vue), because an unboxed icon made the icon-to-label gap differ between the two tabs by ~1.6px, against the app's law that icons never float unboxed next to text. A geometric test covers it.
Environments have a user-assigned colour from Studio's own palette, none by default (LAW 07: one palette). ColorPicker was promoted to theme/primitives/ and domain/color.ts is the shared home.
Environment colour is shown via an app-drawn EnvironmentSelect, the toolbar rail and head dot of both request views, the environment's own tab, the manage dialog and the variables overview panel; history rows and the tab strip are deliberately excluded.

### v1.2 P19 (new) Connection dialog sizing, Mongo console fixes, query-result selection, and SQL tooling regression
ConnectionDialog.vue is one static 620×520 size for both steps and every tab/sub-tab, so the dialog does not resize when switching tabs.
A geometry test in connection-dialog-tabs.spec.ts records the dialog box across every step/tab/sub-tab/engine-family combination, asserts it never moves, and asserts no pane's scrollHeight exceeds its clientHeight.
The Mongo filter/order pair is in the collection view (views/documents/DocumentView.vue), not the query console, which has no filter or order input at all.
The Mongo collection filter box looked inert because it was the only filter surface with no prefix label, and its typed value is painted through the syntax overlay in chrome-like greys and pale blues; DocumentView.vue now gives it a FILTER label.
FilterToolbar.vue had three wiring gaps, fixed on both Mongo boxes: no no-op guard on blur, no @escape revert, no resync watcher. An idle blur now issues zero new data:read/data:count calls and the exact count survives.
views/shared/clipboardFormats.ts and views/shared/slick/selection.ts live in views/shared/ because biome.json makes views/console/** importing views/grid/** a lint error.
The console's tabular result uses a SlickHybridSelectionModel supporting row, column and range selection, with ⌘C and a context menu (views/console/resultMenu.ts) mirroring views/grid/menu.ts's vocabulary.
Document/key-value console rows have a menu with "Copy as JSON" and "Copy all as JSON"; the Mongo collection view's row menu has the same item.
The SQL formatter itself is not broken (sql-formatter 15.8.2 formats a twenty-case battery correctly); it read as broken because of three P13 issues: all-or-nothing failure on one unparseable fragment, caret jumping to offset 0 (OQ-2), and keywordCase 'preserve' making an already-formatted document a silent no-op.
formatConsoleText is per-statement, returning {text, ok, failures}, so an unparseable fragment (e.g. \dt after a good SELECT) does not block its neighbours; a warn strip names the failed statement and a note strip says "Already formatted." for a byte-identical no-op.
The caret survives a reformat by statement index via CodeMirrorHost's opt-in keepSelectionOnExternalSync/setCursor props, default off so other hosts are unchanged; this closes v1.1 P13 OQ-2.
SQL completion source precedence is: user DDL document schema (wins wholesale), then cached schema columns, then table names from the project tree's cache via consoleRelationNames (same technique as mongoCollectionNames), then undefined; sources are never merged per table.
The 'Fill from connection' button/progress state and the no-schema hint strip were removed; the Schema (DDL) dialog, saveDdl/ensureDdl/parseDdl and the connection-row menu entry remain, as a deliberate override rather than the only schema supply.
A new --kira-state-on token (#4ec9b0, ~168° hue) replaces --kira-accent (#0078d4) for the "filter/sort/projection applied" indicator, because the accent is within 8° of the #569cd6/#9cdcfe query-text highlight blues and that hue region is used by no syntax token or other state colour.
--kira-state-on is applied to .ph-active, IconButton's .has-indicator dot and StreamView's partition button; the SlickGrid sort chevron deliberately stays on neutral --kira-fg/--kira-fg-muted.
The Adapter interface has a SchemaColumns method and Caps.SchemaColumns flag, true for the five SQL kinds (postgres, mysql, mariadb, sqlite, clickhouse) and false for mongo/redis/kafka/sqs/s3, which return adapters.Unsupported for it.
Each SQL adapter's listSchemaColumns is a widened form of its existing per-object column query (schema-wide WHERE, no relname/TABLE_NAME filter), never a loop over relations.
Postgres and mysqlfamily SchemaColumns fold IsPrimaryKey into the same query; clickhouse SchemaColumns always reports IsPrimaryKey false per its D18/D23 rule.
tree.Service.SchemaColumns uses a fourth metadata_cache kind (columns) that shares the container's existing (connection_id, path) row instead of one row per relation, to stay within F8's 200-row budget.
SchemaColumns follows the same cache-aside shape as Children/Describe/Definition, with requireConnected checked after the cache check, so cached results are served while disconnected.
The frontend schema-columns state (state/schemaColumns.ts, ensureSchemaColumns) is idempotent, single-flight and fire-and-forget; it is invalidated by the onConnectionMetadataInvalidated broadcast, and ConsoleView.vue triggers it on mount and on container-path change.
namespaceFromCached (ddl.ts) projects cached RelationColumns into lang-sql's namespace shape byte-for-byte like toSqlNamespace.
effectiveSchema (state/schemaColumns.ts) is the DdlSchema-shaped projection that lint and hover read via ConsoleView.vue's ddlSchema computed, so completion, diagnostics and hover agree on what the console knows.
mongoFilterCandidates/mongoSortCandidates live in views/shared/mongoFieldSample.ts because views/console/** may not import views/documents/**.
The Mongo console offers a completion position for a bare identifier inside a db.<collection>.<method>(…) call, giving that collection's sampled field names merged with the BSON-constructor list; DocumentView.vue pushes the sample on page load and the console only reads it, never fetches.
The new schema-columns cache kind has no staleness/TTL policy (P24's question), there is no cross-schema completion (OQ-3), and SchemaColumns' payload has no indexes or foreign keys (OQ-2).

### v1.2 P20 (new) README feature overview
README.md presents what the app does today as a short feature-by-feature summary in brief mentions, not implementation detail; docs/ARCHITECTURE.md stays the source of truth for how it is built.
The README intro and Status section name both workbenches: Studio (shipped through v1.1) and Api (in development as the v1.2 chapter).
The README has a Studio features section (the prior feature list, retitled unchanged) and an Api features section covering the request builder, collections, environments/variables, curl import/export, response history, request timeline and gRPC.
The Api request builder supports body modes raw, syntax-highlighted code, form-urlencoded, multipart form-data and binary file.
Api environments/variables support colour and Faker.
Api response history is capped at 30 entries.
Api has no dedicated Basic/Bearer/API-key/OAuth2 auth UI; auth is set via the Headers panel, matching curl parity.
Check README feature claims against the frontend source; do not assume them from the SPEC's phase titles, because a claimed auth UI turned out not to exist.
The README Documentation and top-level-layout sections link docs/v1.2/ as the live chapter and docs/v1.1/ as the reference for the completed chapter.

### v1.2 P21 (new) Code review, three rounds — whole application
P21 is a three-round code review of the entire application (Studio and Api, every phase up to P20), a from-scratch review of the current tree, not a diff. Earlier reviews were module-scoped (P14, Api only); P21 is sequenced last so it reads the final shipped state.
Each review round uses three parallel Opus analysis agents (architecture/structure/maintainability/security, functional correctness/business logic, performance/resource efficiency) that report findings only, then one sequential Sonnet agent fixes everything found.
MySQL/MariaDB URI query parameters no longer splice into a connect-time SET statement.
sslmode=require verifies the server certificate on Redis/MongoDB (matching Kafka), with an explicit verify-none escape hatch, and rediss:// enables TLS.
An imported Postman collection's file reference is never carried into a live, sendable path, and curl import (-F name=@path, a lone --data-binary @path, -T path) likewise no longer resolves a live local file path, to prevent file exfiltration.
Response headers are masked for secrets the same as the request half; a successful gRPC call's StatusMessage/headers/trailers are masked before the renderer or kira.db sees them.
All transient revealed-secret maps (variables, history popover, Copy-as-curl) re-mask on the same 5-minute auth grace expiry, not only when their dialog closes.
internal/ipcerr lives outside internal/bridge, and a go list -deps test guards the layering; the layering test enumerates every internal/* package rather than a hand-maintained list.
The database file is named kira.db (not kira.sqlite) since the Go port; docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, README and PACKAGING were corrected.
A failed collection import rolls back the collection it partially created, and postman.Parse's whole-file read is bounded.
safeRun's recover() preserves a panicked *adapters.Error's own code instead of always folding to E_INTERNAL.
StreamView.vue's compose dialog and Delete button read Caps instead of connection.kind; DocumentView and StreamView also gate writes on the connection's ReadOnly flag as well as adapter Caps.
connections.Update reconnects a live connection when its destination or ReadOnly flag changes, so the adapter, cache and server-side enforcement do not stay pointed at the old destination.
kira:v2 ciphertext does not bind additional authenticated data to its row; this is an accepted design constraint because binding it would break SecretStore.copy()'s duplication path.
sslmode vocabulary differs across the six adapters ("six adapters, six vocabularies"); this duplication and libpq's allow semantics remain an open separate refactor, while Kafka verify-none/insecure, ClickHouse prefer and Postgres verify-ca are now accepted.
MySQL/MariaDB TLS ServerName uses net.SplitHostPort (fixing IPv6 hosts), and its process-global TLS config registry no longer leaks one entry per connection id.
Concurrent Test connection presses across multi-window no longer share one Preconnect key, so they cannot kill each other's pre-connect script; a pre-connect script's fallback PATH no longer leads with an empty (.) element.
internal/storage/model reuses internal/httpclient types; this coupling is a known open refactor.
Generated SQL literals are dialect-aware (backslash escaping), and dollar-quoting in the SQL splitter/linter is Postgres-only.
The {{name | transform}} pipe vocabulary (base64/urldecode/case-mapping) is byte-identical between Go and TypeScript.
The column projection cannot be reduced to zero columns, and hiding one column of a composite primary key fails loudly naming the hidden column rather than reaching an opaque server-side refusal; a blanket primary-key lock on Hide column was wrong because it broke tested composite-PK behaviour.
Duplicate row(s) no longer stages a truncated cell as real data, and Commit fails loudly instead of silently no-opping on an unaddressable row.
A server-streaming gRPC call's terminal event can no longer be dropped by a network-vs-event-channel race, and a streaming call's history row is recorded before its terminal event fires.
Both history tables cap the whole snapshot rather than field by field, and both history repos gate the byte-budget sweep on a cheap aggregate; the response-history stale flag is sequenced against a concurrent send.
applyLoadFailure sets a real status on disconnect for every view, not just console.
SQS never polls automatically; all reload paths (mutation self-reload, sibling-tab fan-out, project-tree double-click reuse) go through one guarded reload().
Deleting a folder or collection purges every cascade-deleted descendant's cached request, avoiding a live-looking Save button on an orphaned tab.
Copy-as-curl emits a form-data text row's own Content-Type.
A stream/Kafka view's "N total" is scoped to the active partition/offset/timestamp filter rather than the whole topic.
A failed tabsSave no longer permanently blocks a later, identical-looking save.
MariaDB's fake-data generator respects signed integer display widths and mysql/ClickHouse temporal formats.
The row context menu builds clipboard snapshots lazily, and resolveColumnOrder is memoized and no longer O(cols²); the console's document parse cache is pruned to the rendered window.
An oversized page is rejected by its own measured size before being encoded.
Never spread into Array.push in the project tree row builder, because it hard-fails past ~65k rows.
Known deferred items: duplicated protocol-neutral field-walk in internal/apivars and bridge/grpc.go; nested-block-comment splitting edge case; DocumentView's per-toggle full-page height recompute and ConsoleResultGrid's full materialization of every document row (only cache pruning was fixed).
budgets.spec.ts's scroll p50 threshold is a documented pre-existing flake in the test:ui suite, passing in isolation.
The gRPC live-message buffer is trimmed to exactly its cap, keeping the most recent 10,000 messages; trimming to 90% of the cap was reverted because it broke the D15/D17 contract.
The gRPC live-stream buffer uses markRaw so incoming messages are not deep-reactivated.
MySQL/MariaDB connections serialize concurrent operations against the same pinned connection, matching Postgres's existing fix.
The Postgres, MySQL/MariaDB and Redis connection sets use dial single-flight and a lock-free LRU-eviction split, so eviction does not block operations and concurrent dials of the same cold database do not race or leak connections.
variables.Upsert purges a variable's plaintext-value history when the variable becomes a secret, so earlier plaintext revisions are not readable through the history endpoint.
oplog's Stop() blocks until its own consumer goroutine has exited, closing a shutdown race.
connections.Update and Insert route a changed secret through the secret store transactionally, as a fresh connection does, so a rotated password is not left under the connection's old field.
httpclient redirect handling strips caller-supplied headers, including auth tokens, before following a cross-host redirect.
Collection export writes its file atomically, so a failed write cannot leave a half-written file in place of the original.
Postman export reduces a local absolute file path to its base name instead of writing it into the exported collection.
SQLite DSN parsing rejects URI metacharacters that could smuggle extra file: query parameters past the app's validation.
Grid and console clipboard TSV export neutralizes a leading formula-trigger character (=, +, -, @, tab, CR), as CSV export already did (CWE-1236).
The Tree, Connections and Collections services have inconsistent context.Context threading; this was left unfixed because it is a large, invasive refactor across every call site with no single active bug behind it.
The fake-data generator clamps every generator's output to its declared column bounds, so finance.amount, binary.hex and others cannot emit out-of-bounds values.
The curl importer/generator round-trips --data-urlencode verbatim and applies the existing ;-in-value guard to -F.
The URL query codec treats a bare + and an escaped %2B symmetrically on round trip.
ClickHouse computeOrderBySql falls back to a deterministic all-columns ORDER BY when no better ordering is available.
enginecache's stale-flip path uses ByteLru.Update() rather than a Set-based re-insert, which lost the entry's place in LRU eviction order.
The paged find box budgets its per-frame scan by cell count rather than row count and debounces query input at 150 ms, the same as the tree/collections search boxes.
The HTTP response find bar's findRanges is memoized by (doc, query).
The browse view's loaded node list is markRaw'd rather than deep-reactive, matching the project tree, since it can hold up to 200,000 entries.
TabsRepo.Save upserts and prunes rows instead of deleting and reinserting every row for the window on each save.
Read pendingChanges per cell in SlickGrid's staged-edit extractor, not at build time, because the extractor is not rebuilt on every staging change; hoisting the read broke staged-edit rendering.
rangeHighlightPlugin's full-document rescan per keystroke was deliberately not changed: it is a CodeMirror ViewPlugin with no unit-test seam and a correctness risk around viewport-boundary widening.
BrowseView.vue's filter-input debounce was skipped because it has no Playwright coverage to verify a script-setup refactor.
The gRPC response pane's per-batch row-height remap was left unchanged because it lives in VirtualList.vue, shared across grid/documents/browse/console/gRPC, so changes carry a large blast radius.

### v1.2 P22 (new) Sixth user-driven batch — Api/Studio polish, global sizing tokens, search sweep, and schema-aware SQL tooling
SQL/Mongo table and column completion must be driven automatically by the schema metadata the app already fetches and caches from the live connection, with no manual step.
The language layer must never connect to the real database itself for completion; cached metadata is enough. The DDL/LSP design was a misunderstanding.
P19's "Fill from connection" button, which staged cached schema metadata into a "Schema (DDL)" document the user must open and click, was the wrong shape for schema-aware completion.
Control height is exposed as a small set of global CSS custom properties so raising one token raises inputs, dropdowns and other form controls together.
Search affordances in all Studio and Api panels that can support search must use the app's one shared search component, uniformly.
Every autocomplete dropdown in the app (SQL/Mongo completion, header names, variable names, faker functions) renders through one visually uniform popup component/style.
--kira-state-on (active-filter/order-by indicator, introduced by P19) is #e0a33c (gold/amber), replacing the teal.
The .p-method class has no tinted background anywhere and keeps only its text colour; the filter: brightness() hover workaround the fill needed was deleted. Studio has no method/kind chip with a background fill (its tree renders an EngineIcon), so the change lands entirely in Api.
Header value autocomplete offers full canned values for headers like Content-Type and a prefix-only vocabulary (Bearer, Basic, Digest, etc.) for Authorization.
Every configurable row in the request builder (headers, params, form-data fields, other row-shaped fields) gets a Description field, as P17 added to variables/environments.
The collections panel has an Environments category at the bottom, alongside rather than inside the folder/request tree, collapsed by default. Clicking an environment opens it in a new tab via the same openVariableSetTab call as EnvironmentsDialog's row click, and the dialog is untouched.
The Mongo document/console copy action is a three-format submenu (Shell / Canonical Extended JSON / Relaxed Extended JSON) for a single document and a whole result set, matching the SQL grid's Copy row(s) idiom. Shell mode is mongosh-style, e.g. ObjectId("...")/ISODate("..."); canonicalToRelaxed in views/shared/document/ejson.ts is new.
On app close, the app remembers which top-level module (Studio or Api) was active per window and reopens into that module.
Adding a new row to a row-insertable table should scroll the new row into view. FieldRowsTable, MetadataTable and VariableSetView scroll their newly appeared trailing blank row into view on growth, never on a shrink.
PanelSplitter has an opt-in divider prop that draws a box-shadow hairline at rest. It is applied to HttpRequestView, GrpcRequestView and CellEditorDock (which dropped its local border-top workaround), and not to WorkbenchShell's two splitters, whose grid gap already reads as a groove.
The response status code is an always-visible inline line in both response panes; its tooltip was removed on purpose. HTTP's history list, timeline and diff dialog, and gRPC's call history, now carry v-tooltip="statusHint(...)" like the two response panes; the inline line is never tooltip-only.
P22 is split into three plans: P22 (shared tokens/primitives/shell, must land first), P22b (per-surface Api and Studio polish) and P22c (schema-aware completion).
P22 part 1 provides control-height roles, a disabled-primary contrast fix and a shared completion-popup block, which parts 2 and 3 consume.
P22 part 3 is the only part touching Go, the wire and the SQLite schema.
Repo convention: recorded batches of reported items are written as one durable batch before their plan exists, and phases are sequenced one at a time (P22 after P21).
When planning for re-checked regression items, root-cause each against the real current tree; never assume either the user's report or the prior phase's 'Implemented' note is right.
The 'no live DB connection from the language layer' constraint stands; P22c revisits P19's DDL-document completion design against cached metadata instead.
The control-height token scale --kira-h-xs/sm/md/lg already exists and all form primitives read it. The --kira-control-h/-lg/-sm, --kira-control-inline-h and --kira-viewhead-h role layer is a pure alias over it, so rendered heights stay unchanged (22/22/26/18px at the 12px default), except .p-view-head.
A chrome-bar token family (--kira-bar-h and friends) splits .p-toolbar (34px) from .p-view-head (28px), a likelier cause of the reported height inconsistency than any control. .p-view-head changed from 28 to 34px to match .p-toolbar, both now using --kira-bar-h.
The page-number input being taller than its neighbours is not reproducible from the stylesheet: every control in that row is --kira-h-sm under one box-sizing: border-box, so measure before any fix.
The pager sat about 76px from the grid's right edge, not ~8px as P16 claimed, because P16's D2 rendered RunState after #toolbar-end with a permanent 7ch reservation. In ViewChrome, RunState is now placed ahead of #toolbar-end, closing the gap in both the data grid and DocumentView.
The console lacked the sel-t/-r/-b/-l selection perimeter layer that P19's port deliberately dropped; fill already matched. The console's result grid now uses the same layer as the SQL data grid, and computeSelEdgeHashes lives in views/shared/slick/selectionEdges.ts because of the biome.json cross-import boundary.
A .p-btn:disabled cascade defect rendered every disabled primary button at a measured 1.13:1 contrast. A disabled primary button (.p-btn.primary and .p-iconbtn.is-primary) is now dimmed with a uniform 0.45 opacity.
The search-affordance sweep covers the five surfaces that have no search plus the one with a non-shared search, since Api request panel search and gRPC search are partly shipped.
There are two row-add idioms: a trailing blank row in four tables, and the SQL grid's staged-insert button.
SQL Format used out.join(';\n\n'), which silently deleted the document's final semicolon on every press, because splitSqlStatements excludes the trailing ; from each statement. formatConsoleText was fixed.
The tree's cached metadata does not contain columns (P19 D5 made a relation a leaf); the SQLite-backed metadata_cache holds ObjectMeta.Columns and is readable with no live connection.
P22c adds a one-round-trip-per-container SchemaColumns adapter capability, cached as a fourth kind on the container's existing cache row (zero net rows against the 200-row cap), and deletes P19's 'Fill from connection' button and no-schema hint strip.
The mode-tab guard in mode-switch.spec.ts measures real ink by screenshotting each tab's icon/label and diffing against its sampled background, not by box-level assertion.
The mode-tab icon renders at native 16px (was 13px in a 16px box) and shares one line-height with the label. A residual per-glyph side-bearing difference (inset 4px→3px) remains and is documented, not chased.
The --kira-icon-optical-y escape-hatch token is wired but unused, left at default 0px, so a later optical fix has one place to land.
One .p-completion* block lives in primitives.css, and its metrics (including per-kind icon glyphs) are mirrored onto CodeMirror's tooltip DOM in editor/theme.ts, so plain-field and console completion popups share one visual spec.
The status-bar CPU/memory tooltip shows only its numbers. The one load-bearing explanatory sentence moved into docs/ARCHITECTURE.md's CPU-convention paragraph.
Each window has a persisted mode column (migration 0014). NormalizeMode maps an unknown value to 'studio', and repos/windows.go GetMode/SetMode mirror SetBounds.
The frontend derives boot mode from windowsEnsure's answer, replacing the old heuristic that used whichever restored tab was marked active.
Per-window bounds persistence is entirely Go-side and native-event-driven, with no frontend IPC counterpart. setMode therefore debounces its own windowsSetMode write like patchLayout in state/layout.ts, and never writes synchronously on the click.
Mode switching must write nothing synchronously (F20 invariant); the "mode switching writes nothing" test case proves it.
The --kira-control-h value was deliberately not raised (OQ-1): the mechanism exists, but picking a new number is a human judgement at the app.
The codicon glyph set is not replaced with inline SVG (OQ-3).
--kira-bar-h's meaning was introduced by a concurrent commit and is not redefined by P22.
packages/api-core has headerValueCompletions: a whole-value vocabulary for Content-Type/Accept etc. and a prefix vocabulary (Bearer , Basic ) for Authorization. It composes with the {{variable}} source and is wired into the value cell as a function of the row's name.
Save sits in the #head-trailing slot of HttpRequestView and GrpcRequestView, so its position does not shift with the dirty mark or an unresolved-variable chip.
A resolved {{variable}} uses its own --kira-var-resolved token, fixing a collision with --kira-syntax-property; the hue was freed up by vacating it in D9.
variableHoverSource and variableCompletionSource are wired onto the HTTP raw/code body editors and the gRPC message editor, which previously had VariableSupport range-highlighting only.
A description field exists on HTTP headers, urlencoded and form-data fields and gRPC metadata rows, behind a per-tab fieldDescriptions toggle that is off by default. Query params have no persisted row of their own (the URL is authoritative, a structural constraint), so they use a paramDescriptions side-car map reconciled on every URL edit.
FieldRowsTable, MetadataTable, VariableRow and VariablesOverviewPanel share one CSS Grid template instead of per-field flex values, so a secret row's extra affordance does not misalign columns. An inheritAttrs: false wrapper fixes the environment/variable views' inputs not filling their width.
The gRPC method select uses the same wrapper + :deep(.p-select) idiom as the target field, so it does not shrink to its widest option. The gRPC toolbar-width test asserts that target field and method select grow together on resize, since both are flex: 1.
OperationsPanel's op log already had a working always-visible filter matching command/kind/error; the only gap, the connection's own name, was added to its existing predicate instead of adding a second search box.
BrowseView's always-visible filter field was converted to the toggle-plus-PanelSearchBox idiom, with rt.filter, filteredNodes, the 'N of M' caption and every data-testid unchanged.
keywordCase 'preserve' is not reversed, because of the ClickHouse hazard from P13 D4.
Descriptions (header/param descriptions) never reach the wire in either protocol, in any format; internal/httpclient.Header has only Name/Value fields.
CollectionsPanel's initVariables() call raced EnvironmentSelect's on a fresh Api-mode mount, double-firing variablesListEnvironments; this was fixed.
resultMenu's 'Copy all > Shell mode' must produce one compact line per document; never map each document through the always-pretty-printing toShellText.
The Adapter interface has SchemaColumns with Caps.SchemaColumns true for the five SQL kinds and false for mongo/redis/kafka/sqs/s3, which return adapters.Unsupported.
Adapters implement listSchemaColumns as a schema-wide widened form of their per-object column query, never a loop over relations; postgres and mysqlfamily fold IsPrimaryKey into the same query. ClickHouse always reports IsPrimaryKey false, per its D18/D23 rule.
tree.Service.SchemaColumns uses a fourth metadata_cache kind 'columns' sharing the container's existing (connection_id, path) row rather than one row per relation, because of F8's 200-row budget; it uses cache-aside with requireConnected after the cache check.
Schema column cache in the studio (state/schemaColumns.ts ensureSchemaColumns) is idempotent, single-flight and fire-and-forget, and is invalidated by the onConnectionMetadataInvalidated broadcast.
SQL console completion precedence is document schema (wins wholesale), then cached schema columns, then tree relations, then undefined, never a per-table merge.
Lint and hover read the schema through effectiveSchema, a DdlSchema-shaped projection, so completion, diagnostics and hover cannot disagree about what the console knows.
The Schema (DDL) dialog remains as a deliberate override rather than the only schema supply.
mongoFilterCandidates/mongoSortCandidates live in views/shared/mongoFieldSample.ts because views/console/** may not import views/documents/**.
The Mongo console offers the collection's sampled field names for a bare identifier inside a db.<collection>.<method>(…) call, merged with the BSON-constructor list; DocumentView pushes the sample on page load and the console never fetches it.
The new schema-columns cache kind has no staleness/TTL policy (left to P24), there is no cross-schema completion (OQ-3), and the SchemaColumns payload has no indexes or foreign keys (OQ-2).

### v1.2 P23 (new) SQLite storage unbounded-growth audit
The P23 audit read all nineteen schema tables and found seventeen already bounded; the two unbounded ones were op_log and filter_history, each with a count cap but no byte cap.
api_response_history is bounded by 256 KiB per body, 30 entries per scope, a 128 MiB table budget and a launch orphan sweep.
grpc_call_history is bounded by 64 KiB per message, 100 messages per entry, 30 per scope, a 32 MiB budget and an orphan sweep.
metadata_cache is capped at 4 MiB per row and 200 rows per connection, and is dropped whole on every reconnect.
api_variable_history trims to 20 entries per variable.
The tabs table is rewritten per window on every save and cascades on delete when the window closes; connections, collections and variables grow only when a person creates something, so none is an unbounded-growth gap.
There is no metrics/telemetry storage: internal/metrics is an in-memory ticker with no table.
There is no on-disk cache alongside kira.db; ~/.kira-studio/ holds only the database, its -wal/-shm files, and logs/, which internal/logging/sweep.go ages out at 30 days.
Before P23, op_log's command column stored an entire pasted console document verbatim, so large scripts re-run many times bypassed the 20,000-row cap in bytes.
Before P23, filter_history was capped at 20 rows per (connection_id, path), with no bound on the number of paths, no byte cap and no liveness oracle.
op_log now truncates command to 64 KiB and error to 8 KiB in OpsRepo.Finish, and sets a command_truncated flag, because the Operations panel's Re-run executes command and must not run a partial script.
The op_log 64 KiB command cap derives from grpc_call_history's per-message figure and from being the largest value keeping the table under twice its budget between two 500-op prunes.
Migration 0015_p23_op_log_bytes.sql adds op_log stored_bytes and command_truncated columns, backfills bytes using CAST(... AS BLOB) so non-ASCII counts bytes rather than characters, purges rows already over the combined cap, and creates the op_log_bytes covering index.
op_log has a 32 MiB table-wide byte budget enforced as a third pass in Prune, using the op_log_bytes covering index; the sweep removes oldest first and never empties the table.
The Operations panel (OperationsPanel.vue) disables Re-run, but not Copy command, on a row whose command was truncated.
filter_history is capped at 4,000 rows per connection (200 paths per connection × 20 per path, matching metadata_cache) and 4 KiB of text per row.
Before P23 nothing returned freed pages to the filesystem (no VACUUM or auto_vacuum), so kira.db was a permanent high-water mark.
buildDSN sets _auto_vacuum=INCREMENTAL (for new databases) and journal_size_limit(4194304) (4 MiB WAL limit); repos.Maintenance.Reclaim runs an incremental_vacuum at startup when the freelist exceeds 16 MiB, wired in main.go beside the two SweepOrphans calls.
docs/ARCHITECTURE.md records the growth-bound table and the standard a new table must meet; it also corrected doc drift where connection_filters is really connection_tree_filters.
Because OpRecord gains commandTruncated (a bridge-visible type shape change), bindings must be regenerated with wails3 task common:generate:bindings and checked against a real backend (-tags server build plus tests/e2e-real/sqlite-real.spec.ts).

### v1.2 P24 (new) DB metadata cache staleness audit
Intended metadata cache behaviour: connecting after idle refreshes cached metadata; navigating the already-loaded tree serves from cache and must not re-fetch; only an explicit user refresh or staleness (written before the connection was last established) triggers a re-fetch.
Before P24, a successful connect deleted every metadata_cache row for that connection (connections/service.go:639), a wipe not a refresh, so every node, table and console opened afterwards was a cold server fetch; this caused the over-fetching.
Navigating a live tree does not re-fetch: expand() early-returns on the renderer's own copy (project/state/tree.ts:164); the grid's describe, the definition view's definition and ensureSchemaColumns are each once-per-tab and read through the cache; nothing polls and nothing auto-connects.
Before P24, explicit Refresh re-fetched only one kind at one path, leaving the other three kinds on the same (connection_id, path) row untouched, and a connection's Refresh re-listed only its root instead of all rows for that connection as P1 §6c's eviction table specifies.
Before P24, TreeService.Invalidate had zero frontend callers, and Refresh on a table called Children on a leaf (a real engine op and op-log row returning an unrendered empty list) while describe/definition/columns payloads stayed stale.
Before P24 the metadata cache had no staleness concept: fetched_at was read only by the eviction ORDER BY, etag was never written non-NULL, and a cache hit won at any age.
Decision: cache staleness is not a TTL, because a TTL would re-fetch mid-session (violating no-refetch on navigation) and miss a reconnect inside its window; stale means written before the connection was most recently established.
Staleness uses ConnectionState.Since as the epoch and a per-kind timestamp stored under a reserved fetchedAt key inside payload_json, with no migration, new column or new bridge method.
metadata_cache.Get returns a per-kind fetchedAt map, and tree.Service.getCached bypasses (never drops) a payload written before the connection's own Since.
A successful connect no longer calls DropConnection in attemptConnect; it keeps cache rows, still emits metadataInvalidated, and rows are re-read lazily per opened path, remaining available for the disconnected/launch read (P1 D10, P22c F7).
Per-kind timestamps are required because a row-level fetched_at fails the per-kind hazard case; only the per-kind map passes it.
Every tree Refresh routes through treeInvalidate: refresh, refreshConnection and refreshObject drop the whole row (or every row for a connection) before re-reading, and menus.ts sends a leaf's Refresh to refreshObject so it no longer calls Children on a table/collection.
dropSchemaColumns clears the console's completion cache on every explicit refresh, not only on reconnect.
P24 extended tests/ui/tree.spec.ts with container- and leaf-refresh assertions, checked via control.log() rather than opsCount() where more precise.
budgets.spec.ts is a documented pre-existing flake in the full test:ui suite (cross-file worker contention; scroll p50 threshold); it passes when re-run alone.
The Adapter interface has a SchemaColumns method and Caps.SchemaColumns flag, true for the five SQL kinds (postgres, mysql, mariadb, sqlite, clickhouse) and false for mongo/redis/kafka/sqs/s3, which return adapters.Unsupported for it.
Each SQL adapter's listSchemaColumns is a widened form of its existing per-object column query (schema-wide WHERE, no relname/TABLE_NAME filter), never a loop over relations.
In SchemaColumns, postgres and mysqlfamily fold IsPrimaryKey into the same query; clickhouse always reports IsPrimaryKey false per its D18/D23 rule.
tree.Service.SchemaColumns uses a fourth metadata_cache kind, columns, sharing the container's existing (connection_id, path) row instead of one row per relation, to respect F8's 200-row budget; it is cache-aside with requireConnected after the cache check, like Children/Describe/Definition.
The frontend schema-columns cache (state/schemaColumns.ts ensureSchemaColumns) is idempotent, single-flight and fire-and-forget, and is invalidated by the onConnectionMetadataInvalidated broadcast that project/state/tree.ts also subscribes to.
SQL completion source precedence is document DDL (wins wholesale) → cached schema columns → tree relations → undefined, never a per-table merge.
namespaceFromCached (ddl.ts) projects cached RelationColumns into lang-sql's namespace shape byte-for-byte like toSqlNamespace.
effectiveSchema (state/schemaColumns.ts) is the DdlSchema-shaped projection that lint and hover read via ConsoleView.vue's ddlSchema computed, so completion, diagnostics and hover agree about what the console knows.
The 'Fill from connection' button/progress state (P19 D15) and the no-schema hint strip (D16) were removed; the Schema (DDL) dialog, saveDdl/ensureDdl/parseDdl and the connection-row menu entry remain, now framed as a deliberate override rather than the only schema supply.
mongoFilterCandidates/mongoSortCandidates live in views/shared/mongoFieldSample.ts because views/console/** may not import views/documents/**.
The Mongo console offers a completion for a bare identifier inside a db.<collection>.<method>(…) call: that collection's sampled field names, pushed by DocumentView.vue on page load and never fetched by the console, merged with the BSON-constructor list.
docs/ARCHITECTURE.md's Caching section records the fourth metadata_cache kind and hands two open items to P24.
P22c deliberately has no staleness/TTL policy for the new cache kind (left to P24), no cross-schema completion (OQ-3), and no indexes/foreign keys in the SchemaColumns payload (OQ-2).

### v1.2 P25 (new) DataGrip connection import
P25 adds DataGrip connection import: the user picks a local JetBrains DataGrip project folder with a file picker, and the import reads connections and saved passwords from files already on disk without any interactive DataGrip/JetBrains login.
A DataGrip project's data sources live in .idea/dataSources.xml (component DataSourceManagerImpl, one data-source element per source with driver-ref, jdbc-driver and jdbc-url) plus .idea/dataSources.local.xml (component dataSourceStorageLocal), correlated by uuid.
dataSources.local.xml carries user-name, secret-storage and a database-info dbms hint for each data source; neither XML file holds the password, except for a URL-only source whose jdbc-url contains user:password@.
DataGrip stores passwords in the IntelliJ Platform PasswordSafe under the service name 'IntelliJ Platform DB — <uuid>' (em dash), where the key is the data source uuid, per generateServiceName(subsystem, key) in CredentialAttributes.kt.
The 'DB' subsystem string appears in no JetBrains source because the database tooling is closed; it rests on four agreeing third-party reimplementations.
The secret-storage values master_key, memory and forget map to DataGrip's Forever, Until restart and Never by inference from real files, and are used only to word a miss.
PasswordSafe has three backends; the KEEPASS file store is not the default anywhere. The default is KEYCHAIN: the macOS Keychain on macOS and the freedesktop Secret Service over libsecret on Linux.
The DataGrip import reads the macOS Keychain only. A project configured with PROVIDER=KEEPASS gets a named credential-store-unsupported refusal instead of a file-store retry.
The c.pwd/c.kdbx KeePass file-store fallback (kdbx.go, mainkey.go, the gokeepasslib dependency, and the testdata/passwordsafe fixtures and generator) was removed because the user asked only for macOS Keychain; it came from misreading the user's description of the credential store internals.
Linux Secret Service (needs libsecret over cgo, deliberately absent from this repo's Go) and Windows DPAPI are refused by name; every format uncertainty must fail loudly with a specific 'unsupported DataGrip/IDE version' message rather than yield a silently wrong password.
No Go library exists for the IntelliJ credential-store glue, and the only complete implementation is AGPL-3.0 Swift, which cannot be vendored into this MIT repo; DBeaver's DataGrip-import request is closed unimplemented.
The implementation is in internal/datagrip (project XML parse/correlate, engine cascade, macOS Keychain query, Scan/Apply), with generated test fixtures in internal/datagrip/testdata/gen.
The project-folder picker is bridge.Dialogs.OpenDirectory / FilesService.ChooseFolder, and bridge.DataGripService.Scan/.Import send only the project path across the bridge.
The Studio import dialog is DataGripImportDialog.vue, reachable from ProjectPanel.vue's header and StudioStart.vue's first-run screen, with tests in tests/ui/datagrip-import.spec.ts.
DataGrip import is a distinct self-contained capability, not a change to an existing import path (Postman import is collections, not connections), and is its own phase because of its reverse-engineering risk, with no dependency on P22-P24.

### v1.2 P26 (new) Separate interface font from data font
P26 splits the single --kira-font-family token (theme/tokens.css, Menlo, monospace, applied to body in theme/base.css) into a customizable data font (--kira-font-data) and a fixed interface font (--kira-font-ui).
The data font stays monospace, is one of P28's fifteen FONT_CHOICES, and is customizable via the Settings dialog's font dropdown; it applies to surfaces rendering database/API content (grids, document/key-value views, CodeMirror editors, console).
The interface font for UI chrome (panels, dialogs, buttons, menus, labels, tabs) is not customizable (no Settings entry) and is fixed to VS Code's UI font stack: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe WPC", "Segoe UI", system-ui, "Ubuntu", "Droid Sans", sans-serif.
The interface font stack must include system-ui, which VS Code's own comment calls load-bearing on Linux; the originally quoted string omitted it. The stack is the union of VS Code's per-platform rules, exported as DEFAULT_FONT_FAMILY and published as --vscode-font-family.
VS Code's editor font (--vscode-editor-font-family) stays monospace and user-configurable; it is the wrong precedent for the interface font and must not be copied.
The split is a reversion: the design system primitives.css was ported from has two type roles (--font-ui and --font-mono) governed by LAW 08: mono is for data (strings from a database); if the app wrote it, it is UI.
P26 supersedes v1 SPEC §8.2's sentence that the whole app uses one font family and size; call sites are classified by LAW 08.
The .p-input.ui class in primitives.css hard-coded a sans stack outside any token; the plan folds that literal into the interface-font token instead of keeping a second definition.
Inventory: 43 --kira-font-family hits, 38 real consumers across 25 files, plus body, plus .p-completion which needed a declaration. 36 stay data; 3 move to chrome (cell editor's format select, its generate menu, the grid's multi-sort order badge).
Changing body to the interface font carries every chrome surface lacking its own declaration, because Tailwind's preflight gives form controls font: inherit.
--kira-font-size is deliberately left unsplit: the type scale is not cleanly role-split (--kira-t-md equals --kira-font-size with mixed consumers), P22 D1 coupled --kira-t-xs/-sm/-lg to that setting on purpose, and Row height already governs tree, grid and lists.
The Settings dialog needs no copy change (it already says "Data font" / "Data font size"), and fonts.ts's availability probe needs no change because it is only called on appearance.fontFamily and the fixed stack ends in sans-serif.
No Settings entry for the interface font is built, even though the design-system artboard draws one.
The .p-completion popup has an explicit --kira-font-data declaration, keeping it consistent with the CodeMirror completion popup unified by P22 D8; a fontFamily parity assertion in autocomplete.spec.ts guards it.
font-roles.spec.ts asserts that data and chrome surfaces resolve different font tokens.
If mode-switch.spec.ts's P22 D5/D6 ink measurement breaks from a font change, fix it with --kira-icon-optical-y, never by relaxing the bound.
mode-switch.spec.ts passed unchanged after the font split, so --kira-icon-optical-y stays undeclared.
P26 was implemented in six commits (T1-T6), introducing --kira-font-data and --kira-font-ui and renaming the 36 data sites.
The split was requested because one font served two jobs, making the P28 font dropdown appear to change button/label text when users only meant to change table data rendering.

### v1.2 P27 (new) Test-suite speed
Image pull is not the dominant cost of the Go test tier once container images are cached.
The repo has no go test -p pin anywhere, and CLAUDE.md prescribes no -p 1, so nothing in the Go tier is serialized by a -p setting.
internal/ipcfixture was the slowest Go package because it starts six containers one after another and tears them down serially in TestMain.
t.Parallel() cannot speed up ipcfixture because it panics against the t.Setenv("KIRA_HOME", …) call in ipcfixture/harness.go.
A Prewarm/StopConcurrently seam over testsupport's mutex-guarded fixture memo starts and stops containers concurrently. It is called from the TestMains of ipcfixture, adapters/kafka and adapters/mysqlfamily, with no production-code change.
The testcontainers Kafka module's log-based wait fires before the advertised listener serves, so the seed's first request can be closed mid-ApiVersions when brokers start concurrently. A client.Ping poll (waitKafkaBrokerReady) before seedKafka fixes it.
IsDockerAvailable is memoized with sync.Once, because the docker info probe had 144 call sites at about 60 ms each.
The Go tier go test ./apps/kira-studio/internal/... dropped from about 95.8 s (102.5 s in the implementation worktree) to about 58 s, a reduction of about 43%. The Kafka fix produced zero failures.
For bun run test:ui, raising Playwright workers alone breaks the wall-clock budgets in budgets.spec.ts (12 ms scroll budget), which measured 15 ms at 4 workers and 22 ms at 3, because the spec shares the box with other WebKit instances.
Wall-clock-budget specs (budgets.spec.ts, perf.spec.ts and the two '150 ms sandbox gate' tests in slick-grid.spec.ts) run in a serial ui-timing Playwright project with dependencies on ui. The rest run in the ui project with workers '100%'. The slick-grid tests are selected by title via grep/grepInvert.
The top-level Playwright workers setting in playwright.config.ts is the real worker-pool size; a project's own workers can only narrow it. It was moved from '50%' to '100%'.
bun run test:ui went from 351 s to about 269-275 s with 245/245 passing. The ipc-frontend tier went from 25.9 s to 10.5 s with workers '100%'. typecheck runs its four independent projects concurrently, saving about 30%.
Declined: go test -p 8, because the default is already GOMAXPROCS and a literal would cut parallelism on bigger machines. Also declined: caching bun run build:test (0.7% of test:ui) and replacing the 59 waitForTimeout sites (mostly deliberate frame pacing).
Container reuse across test runs was declined because the adapter suites mutate data and run DDL, so a reused container would carry the previous run's writes into the next run.
scripts/setup.sh already caches its bindings step: the first run took 4.43 s and the second 0.135 s with the bindings step skipped.
grpcclient's startEchoServer race was fixed in the test with a real grpc_reflection_v1 ServerReflectionInfo round-trip readiness gate. An EOF failure still occurs in roughly 30-40% of sampled runs in the sandbox, and reproduces under CPU stress with no Docker involved. Fully closing it would need a client-side retry in internal/grpcclient's production dial path, which is out of this phase's scope.
internal/shell's TestSecondShouldQuitReturnsTrue can flake under load because its 1 s internal handshake timeout is exceeded; it is attributed to environmental noise.
P27 deleted, skipped and loosened no tests or assertions, and swapped no runner. Environment-noise flakes were reported rather than masked with longer timeouts or looser bounds.

### v1.2 P28 (new) Seventh user-driven batch — Api/Studio polish, floating-surface hardening, the menu bar, and the window's webvi...
In Api, the HTTP/gRPC status-code explanation becomes the status chip's tooltip instead of a permanent line, reversing D11/P18 D13.
HttpRequestView and GrpcRequestView test only isDynamicName for the unresolved chip, so all 57 FAKE_NAMES ({{fake.*}} references) are wrongly flagged as unknown; P28 stops counting them into the unresolved chip.
Postman $name aliases leave autocomplete and the reference dialog and survive only as an import-time rewrite through the exhaustive ALIAS_TO_FAKE table.
Pasting a curl command into the Api URL field routes through the existing P7 parser.
A single find bar with the data views' own case/word/regex toggles sits above both the Api request and response panels.
In Api, the field-name column joins the variable-hover surface, the Variables button uses the variable-group icon instead of symbol-variable, and every Api dropdown anchors left.
ViewChrome can omit run controls that a variables tab has no use for, and environment name/description fields get real labels.
Environment management moves out of EnvironmentsDialog into a real tab, the sidebar environments category is removed (reversing P22b D8), and the server-environment icon replaces the gear.
The Studio console grid gets the SQL data view's live cell-range drag highlight; the data view already has it and only the console lacks the onCellRangeSelecting subscription.
In Studio, a right-click paints the column selection it already makes and no longer lets the following interaction collapse a multi-row selection; the toolbar delete appeared to do nothing because it read a selection the menu had already destroyed, behind an enablement check that never consulted one.
Studio sort control loses 10px of flex chrome, and initial column width gets its own 96px floor separate from the 64px resize floor.
The in-cell FK/PK button reserves padding again instead of overlaying the text, reversing item 12 of P22b's coordinator round.
The Studio pager returns to DataToolbar, as a targeted revert of commit d2892f49.
Item 9 (Mongo's plain copy) is deliberately not implemented: every Mongo copy affordance is an explicitly labelled format (Shell mode / Canonical Extended JSON / Relaxed Extended JSON), two of three preserve types, and there is no Mongo copy button anywhere, so no format is rewritten on a guess.
The console's rowAsJsonMenu has exactly one call site, the Redis branch its comment says it is for, so it is not reachable for a Mongo result (contradicting the plan's F9).
floatingPosition gains size() so an over-tall menu scrolls instead of clipping, PopoverPanel and the autocomplete popup teleport out of ancestor stacking/clip contexts, and the five bare z-index literals become one ordered token ladder.
Both import buttons and a New Request action move into the native menu bar, and --kira-statusbar-h shrinks from 26px to 20px.
A closing window navigates its webview to about:blank before the native close, so the WebContent process holds an empty document rather than the app's whole heap; this is implemented entirely in internal/shell/closeflush.go and main.go is not touched.
Wails v3 beta.16 exposes no window-destroy API; macosWebviewWindow.destroy() is dead code and byte-identical to close().
P28 is a user-driven batch from real use, not a code-review round, because CLAUDE.md reserves that name for the three-parallel-agent process; it is sequenced after P27 since it reverses recent P22b decisions.

### v1.2 P29 (new) Bind secret ciphertext to its kind (AAD)
AES-256-GCM AAD in internal/secrets/cipher.go is bound to the secret's kind (scope: connection, variable, variable-history), so a ciphertext only decrypts under the scope it was encrypted for.
Before P29, Seal/Open carried no AAD, so an attacker with raw write access to kira.db (but not the OS Keychain) could move a connections.password ciphertext into api_variables.secret_value and have a variable reveal expose the connection credential.
The secret envelope prefix is bumped from kira:v2: to kira:v3: to mark the AAD format change.
AAD is kind-scoped, not row-scoped, so SecretStore.copy() (ConnectionsRepo.InsertDuplicateWithSecret, VariablesRepo.DuplicateEnvironment) can keep copying ciphertext via raw SQL subquery with no decrypt/re-encrypt and no cipher/keychain dependency at duplicate time.
No backward compatibility: kira:v1: and kira:v2: ciphertexts fail decrypt with a re-enter error once kira:v3: ships; stored connection passwords and API-variable secrets must be re-entered once, with no migration, dual-read or grace period.
The kira:v1: envelope (legacy Chromium safeStorage) already fails decrypt with a "re-enter it" error.
The two internal/connections/service.go Encrypt sites are Create and Update; Duplicate never touches the cipher and copies the raw ciphertext column via InsertDuplicateWithSecret.
internal/storage/repos/variables.go has five Encrypt/Decrypt sites: encryptFor, valueChanged, RevealValue, RevealHistoryValue, mergeSecrets.
VariablesRepo.recordHistory re-encrypts under ScopeVariableHistory using the plaintext callers already hold (valueChanged's decrypted oldPlain) instead of copying the live ciphertext, because a raw copy from api_variables.secret_value to api_variable_history.secret_value is cross-kind and would be unreadable and allow laundering a stolen secret.
internal/secrets/scope.go declares Scope as a named string type with three constants and a valid() check invoked by both Encrypt and Decrypt before any crypto, so a scope typo yields a loud E_SECRET_STORE error.
Cipher API is Encrypt(scope, plain) and Decrypt(scope, stored); all nine production call sites plus recordHistory's new one use it.
The wrong-envelope error message in cipher.go names kira:v3: and reads sensibly for variable reveals as well as connections; decryptFailure's separate message is unchanged.
internal/storage/repos/secret_scope_test.go tests cross-kind ciphertext moves against the app's own tables in both directions.
The no-AAD design was deliberately left open in cipher.go's comment (P21 round 2 finding 10) because a scope string threaded through every call site was out of scope then; dropping v1/v2 compatibility removed the reason for deferral.

<!-- chapter v1.3 -->
## v1.3
Source: docs/v1.3/ at bd0c224688d9. 34 phases.
The v1.3 chapter is the git subsystem, a third top-level subsystem beside studio and api. It ships headless: the git backend runs inside Kira Studio and the frontend is a separately-installed VS Code extension.
The v1.3 git chapter uses fresh phase numbering (G1, G2, …), not a continuation of v1.2's.
v1.2 shipped the Api module, specified in docs/v1.2/SPEC.md.
The branch origin/claude/feature-v1-3 is a superseded attempt at the git chapter and is not built on.
Real GitHub requests run through gh api rather than reading gh's stored credential out from under it.
The diff is produced by an argv-only, no-shell invocation, not a hand-rolled Go diff algorithm.
branch.resolvePr exists and is wired into G11's reaper rather than duplicating it; the exact reaper shape is G11's own design, with a seam G24 can hook rather than rebuild.
The Git module is documented in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (Git module section) and docs/PERF.md §2.13.

### v1.3 G1
The v1.3 G1 goal comprises a socket listener, framing, handshake, a pairing broker, a trust store and a Connected editors pane.
v1.3 G1 is proven end-to-end on app.init and repo.open alone.

### v1.3 G2

### v1.3 G3
Milestone v1.3 G3 covers porcelain parsers with a golden corpus, cat-file --batch, a paged log session, commit store/interner/packing, and graph.stream over FlatBuffers, so the graph renders end to end.

### v1.3 G4
Milestone v1.3 G4 covers commit detail, file tree, diff, blob reads and line-mapped "Go to file", plus the seven host-capability methods wired client-side.

### v1.3 G5
Milestone v1.3 G5 covers refs/tags/branches, checkout with the Go pre-flight engine, revert, linked-worktree detection, an in-progress banner, and an undo slot.

### v1.3 G6

### v1.3 G7
Release v1.3 group G7 covers remote operations: fetch, push, decomposed pull, force-with-lease, protected branches, askpass broker with credential relay, and auto-fetch.

### v1.3 G8
v1.3 G8 covers multi-client hardening: two-windows/two-repos matrix, disconnect teardown, revoke-while-connected, stale-socket recovery, and perf re-baseline against the new transport.

### v1.3 G9
Phase G9 (v1.3) switches the repo watcher from fsnotify's kqueue backend to FSEvents, matching VS Code (@parcel/watcher) and Zed (the notify crate's macOS backend).
fsnotify's kqueue backend needs one open file descriptor per watched directory, including every directory under commonDir/refs (per G2/G3).
FSEvents watches a whole directory tree recursively through one event stream, which eliminates the per-path fd cost entirely instead of only measuring how close it gets to kern.maxfilesperproc.
G8's fd-cost question (F10) was still unresolved after six phases and was promoted to a ship-blocker; it exists only because of kqueue's per-directory fd cost, which G9 removes.
G9 requires a new macOS-only dependency (e.g. github.com/fsnotify/fsevents), a rewrite of internal/gitclient/watcher.go, and re-verification of every existing watcher test under the new backend.
The FSEvents switch is its own phase (G9) rather than folded into G2 or G8, because it is not a small fix.
G9 is sequenced right before Ship, so the packaged extension never ships with the fd-cost risk open.

### v1.3 G10
G10 ships the extension: a vsce package step producing a real .vsix, and DMG bundling where the scripts/sign-bundle.sh/package script copies it into the app bundle at a known runtime path.
G10 adds an Install VS Code Integration button in the Connected editors pane (G1) that runs code --install-extension <path> with argv only and no shell, matching every other spawn in this chapter. It falls back to "reveal in Finder" when the code CLI isn't on PATH.
G10 includes the non-packaging part of upstream's P13: an SCM title-bar button and a status-bar item that open the existing webview; they are entry points, not a redesign of the webview.
G10 includes a command-palette audit that wires a command for every mutating operation existing by then: checkout/revert/branch/tag from G5 and fetch/push/pull from G7.
G10 was moved up from last on 2026-09-07 so the extension is installable and testable sooner, right after hardening; G11 onward are post-ship follow-ups.
Each phase from G11 onward must register its own command-palette command when it lands, because the G10 palette audit is not repeated.
G10 supersedes upstream P13 (Ship), using DMG bundling instead of Marketplace/OpenVSX distribution.

### v1.3 G11
G11 incremental review stores per-file last-reviewed state as a compressed blob snapshot, not just a commit sha, because rewritten history (rebase/squash/amend) can't be diffed by sha alone.
G11 incremental review uses an ordinary git diff when the last-reviewed commit is still an ancestor of HEAD; if history was rewritten, it diffs the stored blob against current content directly.
G11 supports partial/range-level reviewed-vs-unreviewed marking within a file, not just a whole-file toggle.
G11 review state lives in its own SQLite file, review.db, and is TTL-purged after 14 days idle.
G11's reaper shape is its own design, with a seam G24 can hook rather than rebuild. G24 adds the eager purge on PR close (not built in G11), using branch.resolvePr wired into G11's reaper rather than duplicating it.

### v1.3 G12
Phase v1.3 G12 is a connectivity, pairing and review-UI hardening batch of real bugs/UX issues found by using the shipped G10 extension against Kira Studio.
Revoking a connected editor's pairing token does not make a subsequent re-pairing appear in the Connected editors list; it is a stale-list bug, not just a revoke bug.
Pairing appears to require a fresh connect/approval per repo rather than once per VS Code installation, although G1's trust store already keys on per-editor identity (§3.3); G12 will remove the per-repo prompt if nothing genuinely requires it.
Kira Studio should be foregrounded when its pairing dialog appears, using the platform's window-activation API; where that is blocked (no accessibility permission, background launch), it falls back to a system notification.
Connected editors is to be split into its own Settings tab, separate from the git settings it is currently bundled with.
The G3 commit graph does not render at all, a regression; the cause lies somewhere in FlatBuffers framing, graph.stream or the Vue renderer, and it must be root-caused and fixed with no workaround.
The VS Code extension should default to the workspace's own repo by wiring repo.open to the workspace root automatically, falling back to a picker only when no repo is found there; currently it prompts to open a folder even when a git repo is already open.
The extension needs a persistent status affordance distinguishing connecting, connected, actively loading and disconnected-or-broken, sourced from rpcstream's own connection lifecycle rather than inferred.
The review sidebar's diff opens only in VS Code's native diff view and is never rendered inside the webview; its filter and list/tree toggle move into one panel-level toolbar instead of being repeated per commit.
The review sidebar, including G11's new Files pane, is to be restyled to match Kira Studio's visual design by reusing Kira Studio's existing components/tokens rather than the extension's ad hoc styling.
The extension must ship with Kira Studio's own app icon (not a placeholder) and a short extension README.md.
The review sidebar's "open file" action is broken and must be fixed, and every button in that panel is to be converted from text labels to icons for consistency with the rest of the UI.
Triage of which G12 items are genuine regressions versus always-broken, and which touch the G1/G2/G3 backend versus only the extension/webview, happens at the phase's own Opus planning pass.

### v1.3 G13
G13 (v1.3) adds inline AI review comments: flat file+line/range annotations on top of G11's review session, with no threading.
Review comments show in a centralized list ordered by file then line, formatted as plain text to copy into an AI chat.
AI review comments are deliberately just a copy-paste workflow for now, not a live AI integration.
A clear-all action resets a review session's comments.

### v1.3 G14
v1.3 G14 treats the graph rendering nothing as a core-functionality regression: loading returns zero commits even though G12's handshake/boot fix was verified and the panel and its load control work.
The zero-commit graph bug is distinct from the handshake: suspected causes are the data path (graph.stream/logSession/gitstore) or G12's auto-open-repo logic (wrong repo resolved, unborn/detached/wrong-ref starting point, or a swallowed error reported as an empty result).
Root-cause the graph bug against a real repo, not by re-running G12's container-only repro.
The pairing/connect prompt should become a real system-level notification/prompt as its primary mechanism, not window focus with a notification fallback (G12 item 3), so it surfaces above whatever the user is looking at.
The VS Code status-bar connection item is too narrow; less-critical detail should move out of it (e.g. a hover tooltip).
The file tree's indentation should be reduced because it wastes horizontal space.
Font size should follow VS Code's own setting rather than a fixed Kira Studio scale, correcting G12 D14's structure-only restyle; it should track the host like color already does.
The branch review UI is to be redesigned, modeled on GitLens rather than its current design.
A "Go to file" button is to be added to VS Code's native diff editor (where G12 moved every review diff), left of the next/previous-change buttons as in GitLens, reusing G4's line-mapped "Go to file" capability.
The diff "Go to file" button must work for non-checked-out/historical file content too, landing the cursor at the corresponding line.
An "Open in graph" button is to be added to the same diff toolbar, jumping to the commit in the graph view, modeled on GitLens.
G14 is sequenced immediately after G13 and ahead of G15's range-marking feature, because item 1 is a core-functionality regression, not a polish item.

### v1.3 G15
G12 moves the review sidebar's diffs out of the webview into VS Code's own diff view (editor.openRangeDiff), which drops G11's range-level "mark reviewed" capability.
G12 accepts the loss of range-level marking as an interim gap and restores only whole-file marking, so G15 can rebuild range marking against the real editor surface.
G15 adds range/hunk-level review marking inside VS Code's native diff editor, modeled on the built-in Git extension's hunk-staging gutter UI, using gutter decorations and/or per-hunk CodeLens actions on the diff's right-hand document.
G15 wires hunk actions to G11's review.mark RPC using its existing ranges parameter instead of a whole-file call; that parameter is already shipped but unused client-side after G12.
G15 touches only apps/kira-studio-vscode/src: no Go changes, no packages/git-ui, no review.db migration, no CONTRACT_VERSION bump, because G11 already put the range machinery on the wire.
G15's decoration lifecycle, selection-to-LineRange mapping, and re-open-after-new-commits behavior are left to the phase's own Opus planning pass, the same placeholder-then-design approach as G25/G26/G28.
G15 depends on G11 and G12 and has status new.

### v1.3 G16
The webview layout collapse (panel about 75px tall showing 6 of 2004 rows) occurs because neither the document emitted by apps/kira-studio-vscode/src/html.ts nor the bundled webview CSS gives html, body or #app an actual height.
In packages/git-ui, .kv-app (App.vue) and .kv-review-view (ReviewView.vue) both set height: 100%, which resolves to auto because the ancestor chain has no height.
The layout collapse is a real app bug, not a test-harness or theme artifact: it reproduces identically with zero --vscode-* variables injected and with two full theme sets.
DOM/accessibility-tree checks (aria-rowcount matching the real commit count) passed despite the visual collapse, so DOM-shape checks cannot catch this regression.
G16 fix: establish real height from html/body down to #app/.kv-app/.kv-review-view in both webview roots (graph view and review view). Candidates: a rule in html.ts's emitted document, or a rule in packages/git-ui's shared CSS fixing every host at once (which also needs #app/mount() sizing resolved).
VS Code's default body { padding: 0 20px } is never reset in the webviews, silently eating 40px of width from every panel; G16 fixes this.
LoadMoreButton.vue renders a dead "Load the last 0" button when a single page covers all of history, because the exhaustion signal on a chunk is wrong.
The main source of the wrong exhaustion signal is internal/gitsession/walk.go, whose cache-replay path hardcodes Exhausted: false on every replayed chunk.
logsession/session.go has a narrower exhaustion defect, only reachable when the commit count is an exact multiple of the page size.
Fix the exhaustion bugs at their source (walk.go and session.go), not client-side.
G16 must add a guard asserting a real rendered box height, not DOM shape, because no current test tier catches this class of layout regression.
stash.list's pre-existing unhandled-RPC issue is not part of G16; it is tracked at G14 F14 and handed to G17, which owns stash server-side.

### v1.3 G17
Item G17 in v1.3 is stash plus merge-tree pop prediction, wired into G5's blocked-checkout resolution.

### v1.3 G18
G18 moves per-viewer graph and stash display settings out of VS Code's contributes.configuration into an in-app settings dialog opened from the graph view, configurable per repo.
The server-owned settings protectedBranches, fetch.autoInterval and git.path stay where they are and are not in scope for the G18 move.
G18 was triggered by G17's plan flagging a decision on whether to wire the inert kiraVersion.stash.showInGraph setting into the graph view, which would need a CONTRACT_VERSION bump.
Per-viewer display settings move out of apps/kira-studio-vscode/package.json contributes.configuration and app.init's VS-Code-sourced settings snapshot into new per-repo server-side storage plus a dialog in packages/git-ui.
G18 is not designed yet; the full design happens at its own Opus planning pass, using the same placeholder-then-design approach as G25/G26/G28.
Candidate keys to move in G18 from packages/git-core/src/settings/schema.ts are graph.pageSize, graph.scope, stash.showInGraph and stash.includeUntracked, plus any other per-viewer setting found at plan time.
G11's review.db, its own per-repo SQLite file, is one plausible prior-art pattern for G18's per-repo storage, but not a mandate.
G18's design must cover the new or replacing RPC surface and migration/back-compat for values already set in VS Code's settings.json.

### v1.3 G19
Phase G19 (v1.3) is a batch of 15 Git graph, review panel and file-tree UI fixes found by the user's hands-on use of the shipped app, sequenced right after G18.
G19's row fixes only scope and sequencing; the full design and exact fix for each item come from the phase's own Opus planning pass, the same placeholder-then-design approach as G12/G14.
G19 Git Graph: checked-out branches get a visual indicator, and the timestamp column is widened because it is too narrow.
G19 Git Graph: rebuild the toolbar and right-click/context menu from Kira Studio's existing design-system components, because the current elements don't match the rest of the app.
G19 Git Graph commit detail panel: the commit message is truncated to a few lines and expands only on click, with the tree of the commit's changes shown below it the same way the review panel shows it.
G19 Review bar: the two compared branches are stacked, with a button to swap base and compared.
G19 Review bar: the filter bar is hidden behind a search button, and every copy button is removed from the panel, with that functionality moved into a right-click context-menu action.
Known bug in the review panel: "see all commit changes" picks up only the last file in the commit instead of all files; G19 fixes it.
G19: when a diff is open and the user navigates to a virtual file (one not on disk at that point, e.g. only at a historical revision), the file's tab gets a lock icon to show it doesn't really exist.
Known bug in the review panel: expanding a commit and clicking a file inside it collapses the commit; expand state must not be lost on a file click.
G19: the review panel must retain its state across close/reopen, gets a "back" button, and is renamed "Kira Version."
G19 file tree/file list (shared across graph detail pane, review panel and elsewhere): use the same font as the rest of the UI instead of the current apparently monospaced font.
G19 file tree: show file-type icons from the codicons set (already a packages/git-ui dependency) matched to extension/type, keeping the modified/deleted/added status indicators but small and secondary beside the file icon.
G19: added/deleted line-count numbers in diff stats are abbreviated with K/M/B suffixes (e.g. 1200 becomes 1.2K).

### v1.3 G20
Phase v1.3 G20 migrates every tooltip and viewport-anchored floating surface across all frontend modules onto Floating UI collision-aware positioning (flip/shift/size), matching the existing precedent in apps/kira-studio/frontend.
packages/git-ui uses 57 plain native HTML title/:title attributes across 19 files as tooltips, which are unstyled and inconsistent with the rest of the app.
apps/kira-studio/frontend's v-tooltip mechanism (workbench/state/tooltip.ts plus theme/floatingPosition.ts, built on @floating-ui/dom) renders position: fixed, teleported to body so ancestor overflow: hidden cannot clip it, and uses the top-of-stack --kira-z-tooltip token.
apps/kira-studio/frontend has a second, bespoke tooltip system: the request panel's JSON/variable-value hover preview (RequestBodyPane.vue variableHoverSource via editor/hover.ts buildHoverSource) uses CodeMirror's native hoverTooltip, bypassing tooltip.ts and AppTooltip.vue.
The CodeMirror hover tooltip is not teleported to body because CodeMirrorHost.vue never configures parent: document.body. It stays inside two overflow: hidden ancestors (.cm-host, .request-pane) and reproducibly renders behind the request panel's toolbar.
CodeMirror's tooltip carries a hardcoded z-index: 500 that is not coordinated with the app's --kira-z-tooltip token.
apps/kira-studio/frontend is not exempt from G20: it needs its own fix for at least the CodeMirror-native tooltip path.
The G20 audit must check every tooltip-producing mechanism in every module (native title, v-tooltip, CodeMirror hoverTooltip, and any other bespoke hover/preview), because a second mechanism already slipped past the first survey.
In packages/git-ui, RowContextMenu.vue hand-rolls a post-mount viewport clamp via getBoundingClientRect and window.innerWidth/innerHeight instead of flip/shift middleware.
In packages/git-ui, App.vue's .kv-branch-force-delete--floating confirmation popup has no clamping and uses raw click-point left/top.
Seven packages/git-ui dropdowns/popovers (BranchPicker, PullStrategyPicker, RepoPicker, review/BaseSelector .kv-base-panel, AppToolbar .kv-push-menu, SearchBox/SearchResults suggestion and error popups) use position: absolute; top: calc(100% + Npx); left: 0 with no viewport awareness.
apps/kira-studio/frontend's ContextMenu.vue, PopoverPanel.vue, AutocompleteField.vue and ErrorPopover.vue are already Floating-UI-based and need no migration.
@floating-ui/dom is a root package.json dependency but not packages/git-ui's own; G20 adds it to packages/git-ui.
G20 depends on G19, which builds packages/kira-ui, a host-agnostic shared component package including KuiContextMenu. G20's RowContextMenu.vue and dropdown migration should build on it if it exists, otherwise coordinate with it rather than duplicate it.

### v1.3 G21
In both the git graph panel and the review panel, build all elements (dialogs, tooltips, buttons, search bars, right-click menus) from Kira Studio's own component library.
In the git graph, give branch/tag labels the same color as the graph line (lane) they represent.
Git graph branch lines' beginnings are not properly connected to the origin and hang disconnected; to be fixed.
The commit SHA column is removed from the git graph; the commit details panel shows one short SHA, and clicking it copies the full SHA, so the separate copy button is removed.
The "show Kira in status bar" option is removed from VS Code entirely, including the setting itself from contributes.configuration, not left inert.
Show file icons from codicons based on the actual file extension, not a coarse category.
Show file status (added/deleted/modified etc.) as just a colored letter, with no chip/badge styling.
Reuse a single shared file-diff-tree component in both the review panel and the git graph panel; do not duplicate implementations.
Both diff file trees (review and git graph) open changes in VS Code's own editor, not the extension's embedded panels.
Single-click on a file in a diff tree opens a diff as a VS Code preview tab (replaced by the next single-click open); only a double-click keeps it permanently open.
G19's D8 added {preview: false} to vscode.diff calls so bulk 'all commit changes' opens land each file in its own persistent tab; bulk multi-file opens keep {preview: false}, while a single click on one file omits it or uses {preview: true}.
G21 items 1 (checked-out HEAD shown in graph), 6 (wider date column) and 8 (all-commit-changes shows all files) duplicate G19's D1, D2 and D8; re-verify against current code and fix only a real remaining problem or regression.
G20's scope is floating/positioned surfaces (tooltips, context menus, dropdowns, popovers), while G21 item 2 is broader (every dialog, button, search bar); whichever phase is implemented second must account for the other's coverage to avoid duplication or gaps.

### v1.3 G22
v1.3 G22 completed reset (3 modes), cherry-pick, and the undo slot.

### v1.3 G23
G23 in v1.3 covers Search: a Go tail scan and a client matcher, with regex-dialect reconciliation (§8).

### v1.3 G24
G24 GitHub PR links detect a GitHub remote from origin and authenticate via the local gh CLI on the Kira Studio backend, with REST PR lookup through gh api. This replaces upstream's VS Code-built-in-provider design, which this chapter can no longer use.
PR links resolve per-commit, not per-branch-tip (decided 2026-09-07), a deliberate departure from most clients including upstream's branch-tip-only design.
The commit graph shows a small indicator on any commit that belongs to a PR, resolved by commit membership rather than whether the branch is checked out, so it works in detached HEAD, mid-branch commits, and non-checked-out branches.
Clicking a commit surfaces the PR link in the existing commit-detail pane (G4's).
PR lookup uses GitHub's "list pull requests associated with a commit" REST endpoint via gh api, resolved lazily per selected commit rather than for every visible graph row, because a bulk per-row check risks the rate-limit budget; the exact mechanism is left to the phase's planning pass.
Upstream's branch-tip badges (branch-picker rows, message-column ref badges opened via ExternalOpener) are kept alongside the new graph indicator, because they answer a different question: whether a branch has an open PR versus whether a specific commit is part of one.
G24 includes a kiraVersion.github.enabled setting, PR number/title matching added to search's ref scope, and wiring G11's eager PR-closed purge into its reaper since branch.resolvePr now exists.
GitHub auth is requested on first use only, never at activation.

### v1.3 G25
v1.3 G25 adds worktree support: git worktree create/list/switch/remove, building on G5's linked-worktree detection.
v1.3 G25 includes a user-configurable prepare script that runs after creating a worktree, with visible progress feedback.

### v1.3 G26
G26 (v1.3) is stacked branches: a sequence of dependent branches, each based on the previous and typically one PR per branch, with restacking (rebasing each branch onto its updated parent when an earlier branch changes) and stack navigation.
G26 stacked branches has no upstream design to port and is not designed yet; the full design is deferred to the phase's own Opus planning pass, using the same placeholder-then-design approach as G25.
G26's design must settle how the stack relationship is tracked, because git has no native concept of a stack.
G26's design must settle the restack algorithm and its conflict/undo story against G5's pre-flight engine and undo slot, and how stacks render against G6's branch review and G24's per-commit PR indicator.

### v1.3 G27
APFS returns filenames in NFD (decomposed) form, while git stores paths as the bytes the committer's platform produced, usually NFC (composed).
A non-ASCII filename can byte-differ between what gitclient/porcelain's parsers (status, diff-tree, for-each-ref) report and what the watcher reports for the same file, breaking any path comparison, map lookup or cache key that assumes byte-equality.
NFC vs NFD path normalization mismatch is a real, well-documented bug class that other git tools have hit.
Decision: normalize paths consistently at ingestion, from git output and from the filesystem alike, rather than patching each comparison site ad hoc.
The G27 audit must cover every path comparison/lookup across gitclient/porcelain, the watcher, gitsession's caches, and the wire contract.
Before assuming the NFC/NFD issue is unaddressed, check whether upstream's TypeScript ever hit it, because Node on macOS gets the same NFD-from-filesystem behavior.

### v1.3 G28
G28 (v1.3) adds auto-stash on checkout: uncommitted changes never block a branch switch; they are stashed automatically and tagged with their origin branch, instead of requiring a manual stash first.
G28 cross-branch apply: the stash list shows each entry's origin branch, and a stash from a different branch can be applied to the currently checked-out branch via a right-click action.
Merge-tree pop prediction from G17 also applies to cross-branch stash apply, because a cross-branch apply is the case most likely to conflict.
G28 auto-detach on worktree conflict: checking out a branch already checked out in another linked worktree fails with git's hard error "already used by worktree"; instead, HEAD is detached at that branch's commit rather than blocking the user.
G28 adds a global/unscoped stash: a separate bucket for entries not tied to any one branch and meant to be reapplied repeatedly (e.g. a WIP experiment or personal local tweak), distinct from auto-stash.
Git's native stash stack is a single ordered pop-once list with no room for keeping and reusing an entry, so the global stash almost certainly does not use it.
G28 has no upstream design to port; the full design (auto-stash trigger point in G5's checkout pre-flight, cross-apply RPC and conflict-prediction reuse, multi-apply stash storage) is deferred to the phase's own Opus planning pass, the same placeholder-then-design approach as G24/G26.
G28 builds on G17's basic stash and depends on G5 and G17.

### v1.3 G29
Every pre-window log.Fatalf failure site in the Go shell's main.go (config.EnsureLayout, logging.Init, storage.Open, repos.New, the settings read, window list/create) reaches only a log file; no window is created and the user sees nothing, so the app silently fails to launch.
G29 requires each boot failure in main.go to be surfaced as a native OS-level message shown before any window exists, not as a UI panel that depends on a window having opened.
A boot failure occurring after a repository has already opened inside an existing window is handled by G14 D3, not by G29.
The schema_version-newer-than-binary refusal in storage.Open prompted G29, which was then generalized to all pre-window boot failures.
The equivalent refusal in internal/gitreview/migrate.go (review.db schema newer than the binary knows) fires mid-session inside an already-open window as an RPC-level error, not a boot blocker; it is out of scope for G29 unless investigation finds it silently swallowed too.

### v1.3 G33
Phase G33 is a docs-only update scoped to the root README.md and docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, plus CLAUDE.md notes; it produces no new code.
The root README.md was silent on the git module: Studio and Api each get a mention, git does not.
docs/ARCHITECTURE.md must describe the git module as a real, shipped subsystem (transport, session model, package list), not as absent or a plan.
docs/v1.3/plans/G<N>-*.md files are per-phase historical records, not living docs, and are left as-is by G33.

### v1.3 G34
Phase G34 (v1.3) targets Kira Studio visual-language parity for packages/git-ui: the graph and review panels' main toolbar and all context/right-click menus use bespoke layout, density and styling instead of packages/kira-ui's Kui* components. The user requested it because proportions and design differ from Kira Studio.
The graph/review UX-fixes batch (docs/v1.3/plans/graph-review-ux-fixes.md §7) treated Kira Studio parity as a deliberate non-goal and documented the density split between the .kv-toolbar/density.css workbench scale and the .kv-skin-kira/kira-structure.css scale (G12 D14/G21 D11).
Unifying the two density scales piecemeal, rather than as its own phase, would make the work harder, not easier.
G34 planning must decide which toolbar/menu elements become real Kui* components and which stay bespoke; SearchBox.vue's ARIA combobox already set a precedent for staying bespoke.
G34 planning must determine whether and how the packages/git-ui webview can consume packages/kira-ui's real tokens/CSS given VS Code webview isolation and CSP, including the first-paint budget cost per docs/PERF.md, and how to reconcile the toolbar's and file trees' two density scales without breaking either surface.

### v1.3 G30
Phase G30 is code review round 1 of 3, applying CLAUDE.md's "Code review" convention to the whole v1.3 chapter, not to one phase.
G30 review scope: all of internal/git*, internal/bridge/rpcstream, the migrated apps/kira-studio-vscode extension, packages/git-* wiring, and every design decision in the v1.3 plan file.
Each G30 review round runs three Opus subagents in parallel, one per dimension (architecture/structure/maintainability/security; functional correctness/business logic; performance/resource efficiency), and they report findings only.
After the reviewers report, one sequential Sonnet subagent fixes every finding and commits each fix individually; no findings document survives the round once fixed.
When a review round finds nothing real, say so; never manufacture a finding.
G30 was moved to the very end of the v1.3 chapter (2026-09-09) so review runs last and covers the chapter's final state, including G33's docs edits and G34's new frontend code. It originally sat right after G29, ahead of G33 (docs) and G34 (styling).
Only G30's row position moved; its identifier stays G30, so earlier phase plan docs that point at "G30-G32" as the review rounds remain correct.
G30 depends on G1–G29, G33 and G34.

### v1.3 G31
G31 is code review round 2 of 3: the same three-dimension cycle as G30, rerun independently over the chapter's current state (after G30 fixes) as a fresh look at the whole chapter, not verification of G30's findings.
Review rounds run independently because a fix landed in one round can itself introduce new problems.
A first review pass over 20+ phases of code from as many separate implementing subagents rarely catches everything in one sweep, so review is repeated in rounds.

### v1.3 G32
Phase G32 of v1.3 is code review round 3 of 3, repeating the same review cycle over the chapter's state after G31's fixes.
If G32's review finds nothing real across all dimensions, the chapter's code is closed out; if it finds something, it is fixed the same way as in the prior two rounds.
The review round count is fixed at three and is not extended on the fly, even if round 3 finds something, per CLAUDE.md's "repeat... for as many rounds as asked".
G32 is the true last phase of v1.3, after which the chapter is done.

<!-- chapter v1.4 -->
## v1.4
Source: docs/v1.4/ at bd0c224688d9. 7 phases.
v1.3 shipped the git subsystem, headless behind a VS Code extension (spec at docs/v1.3/SPEC.md).
v1.4 has no single headline subsystem; it is a set of independent reliability, tooling and feature phases across existing modules.
v1.4 uses fresh phase numbering (P1, P2, …) instead of continuing v1.3's, returning to the P prefix used by v1.1 and v1.2. v1.3 used the G prefix because its chapter was a single subsystem; v1.4 is not, so it does not use G.

### v1.4 P1 Test-suite speed
The v1.4 P1 phase goal is to measure and then cut the wall-clock cost of every test suite in the repo and merge genuine duplication.
The test-speed phase lands first in v1.4 because every later phase pays the suite cost on every loop.
No test-suite duration baseline exists: docs/PERF.md tracks app-level budgets and has never recorded suite duration, so establishing a baseline is the first step.
The Go suite (bun run test:go = go test ./...) has 1596 Test* functions across 259 _test.go files and no t.Parallel() anywhere, so packages run concurrently but tests within a package run serially.
Container fixtures in internal/adapters/testsupport use one container per test binary, memoized by fixture.go and started concurrently by Prewarm.
internal/ipcfixture starts mariadb, mysql, clickhouse, redis, sqs and kafka a second time beside internal/adapters/*'s own six containers in the same ./... run, because a test binary is a process.
Running go test with -race over the full tree takes real minutes, per docs/v1.3/SPEC.md's "Full verification scope" note.
tests/ui/ has 248 tests in 47 spec files, using real WebKit against the real built bundle with fullyParallel; the ui-timing project (4 wall-clock tests, workers: 1) declares dependencies ['ui'], so it waits for all 248 tests before starting.
tests/ui/slick-grid.spec.ts alone takes about 110s, per a comment in playwright.config.ts.
The Bun suites comprise 73 specs in tests/unit/ plus 45 in-source *.test.ts files under packages/ and apps/kira-studio-vscode/.
Other suites: tests/ipc/ has 6 frontend specs, tests/e2e-real/ has 4 specs/6 tests, and apps/kira-studio-vscode/tests/ has 2 Playwright projects.
In .github/workflows/ci.yml, three of four jobs need the checks job, so nothing starts until lint, typecheck, build, test:go and verify:packaging all finish.
CI runs bun run test:go twice: on macOS in checks without Docker and on ubuntu in container-tests with Docker; only darwin && cgo files make the macOS run more than a subset.
scripts/setup.sh regenerates bindings in three separate CI jobs.
test:ipc:fe, test:webview, test:e2e-real and test:matrix run in no CI job.
Merging test coverage is bounded: CLAUDE.md exempts internal/adapters/*/*_test.go from the sparse-unit-test bar and keeps them per-capability, and the P25 general/complete split stays; only genuine duplication there may be pruned.
The 73 + 45 TypeScript specs versus tests/ui/'s 248 tests are the likelier overlap for merging coverage.
The CLAUDE.md rule "implement the whole plan, then test once and fix what's found" exists because the expensive suites are expensive; it is a workaround for what this phase attacks.

### v1.4 P2 Api: import collections from Postman's own local storage
Postman import is file-based: menubar item Import Postman Collection… emits ChannelImportPostman, App.vue switches to Api mode and opens a file chooser, and CollectionsService.Import receives only a path, never the bytes.
Postman import parses the chosen .json with postman.Parse and writes it to kira.db via CollectionsRepo.ImportTree, preserving origin_json for round-trip fidelity (v1.2 P4).
internal/datagrip (v1.2 P25) is prior art for reading another tool's state directly: it locates a JetBrains config directory under the user's home (configdir.go), parses it with Scan, and sends only a path across the bridge.
v1.4 P2 (import Postman collections from Postman desktop's local LevelDB store) was dropped after planning; its plan doc and partial internal/postmanstore implementation were reverted.
Postman's local records are not JSON but Chromium SerializedScriptValue-encoded JS objects, so reading them needs the IndexedDB-over-LevelDB key/value coding scheme, a subset of Blink/V8's value serializer, and a Postman Collection Format v1 to v2.1 conversion.
The LevelDB import was dropped because its complexity (a few hundred lines estimated even when narrowed to plain-data tags) was judged too much for the value of one menubar import action.
go.mod has no LevelDB dependency (github.com/syndtr/goleveldb and github.com/cions/leveldb-cli were added then removed by the revert).

### v1.4 P3 SQL formatting for the remaining SQL editors
The app keeps sql-formatter (15.8.2, already a dependency) as its SQL formatting library rather than swapping it.
The query console Format button splits statements with the same splitter Run all uses and calls formatDialect per statement (views/console/format.ts), via lazy chunk views/console/sqlFormatterEntry.ts (~37 KB gzip, tree-shaken to the five dialects the app speaks).
CodeMirror indentService/indentOnInput over @codemirror/lang-sql was declined as formatter because it only re-indents lines and never re-wraps or normalizes a statement; indentation is not formatting.
Prettier with prettier-plugin-sql was declined because it adds a second formatter runtime whose default backend is sql-formatter, so it adds nothing.
project/SchemaDialog.vue (the per-connection DDL document) mounts CodeMirrorHost with :autocomplete="false", registers no view.format command and has no Format affordance, although the console, gRPC beautify, the menubar Format entry and the global Shift+Alt+F chord exist.
The P3 deliverable is Format coverage for SQL editors that still lack it, starting with SchemaDialog.vue, not a library swap; other SQL-bearing editors in the same state should be audited. This gap remains open.
Bug fix: Format right after typing, then Cmd+Z, wiped the whole query because CodeMirrorHost's external-sync dispatch lacked an isolateHistory annotation, so history()'s newGroupDelay merged it into the typing's undo group.
A fix for the console Format style complaint (sql-formatter's clause-per-line output even for trivial queries) was implemented then reverted at the user's explicit request because it was made without sign-off.
P3 pairs with P4: both close gaps on the same editors, so one pass over SchemaDialog.vue serves both.

### v1.4 P4 SQL editor autocomplete from cached table/column metadata
The data-view filter autocomplete is in views/grid/filterCompletion.ts; FilterToolbar.vue's WHERE/ORDER BY boxes read runtime[tabId].meta.columns, the L1-cached kira:tree:describe result for the relation the tab is open on. These columns are authoritative because they include columns the current projection hides.
The data-view filter autocomplete falls back to the loaded page's own columns when describe() errored, quotes each identifier dialect-correctly only when it needs it, and renders through theme/primitives/completion, not CodeMirror.
The SQL editor's autocomplete lives in views/console/completion.ts and views/console/sqlLanguageService.ts, layered as DDL document first, then cached columns, then bare tree relation names, over @codemirror/lang-sql's schemaCompletionSource/keywordCompletionSource.
state/schemaColumns.ts holds the SQL editor's column cache, filled from control.treeSchemaColumns on the view's own lifecycle hook, and dropped on reconnect and on an explicit tree Refresh.
Never fill the schema column cache from a CompletionSource or on a keystroke; fill it only from the view's lifecycle hook.
The schema column cache is keyed by containerPathFor, which walks the console tab's path back to its last database:/schema: segment.
A console opened at the connection root has path === '' (OperationsPanel.vue's new-console action passes that); openConsoleTab substitutes a real path only for a Postgres connection with a session-remembered Set as default. A root-opened console is a normal case, not an edge case.
For a root-opened console, containerPathFor returns null, so ensureSchemaColumns never fires and cachedRelationsFor returns []; the console falls through to lang-sql's keyword source with no table or column names.
v1.4 P4 decision: give a root-opened console the same cached completion as a container-scoped one, give SchemaDialog.vue's DDL editor completion (P3 touches the same component), and merge the two candidate builders over the same cached column metadata where they genuinely overlap.
Decision: extend the existing completion mechanism rather than build a fresh second completion path, because closing the gap costs far less and a fresh implementation would leave a second path behind.

### v1.4 P5 Git extension: status-bar blame widget
The v1.4 P5 phase adds a git status-bar blame widget showing the commit that last touched the active editor's current line (author, age, summary), with click-through to that commit.
The extension already creates and owns one vscode.StatusBarItem (G10 D16, apps/kira-studio-vscode/src/extension.ts), carrying connection state and G12 D10's debounced in-flight indicator, so status-bar lifecycle, theming and disposal are already solved.
commit.detail (G4) already renders a commit and is the natural click target for the blame widget.
commit.resolvePr (G24) answers which PR a commit belongs to, per-commit rather than per-branch-tip, which is the shape a blame line needs.
A new git-ipc method lands in the surface made of packages/git-ipc's contract plus internal/gitrpc's handler table.
No blame path existed anywhere before this phase: a tree-wide search for blame across apps/, packages/ and docs/ARCHITECTURE.md returns one unrelated hit.
The phase adds a real git blame run through internal/gitclient's streaming runner.
The blame porcelain parser sits beside gitclient/porcelain's existing parsers and is guarded by the committed golden-byte corpus, because it is a case of several interacting rules that CLAUDE.md's testing bar targets.
The new blame contract method requires a CONTRACT_VERSION bump; the version is 33 today.
The extension-side line tracking (active editor, cursor line, invalidation on edit, on save and on repo.changed) has no analogue in the extension today.
Whether blame is computed per-line on demand or per-file incrementally, and how a dirty buffer's line numbers map back to committed lines, are left to the phase's own planning pass.
P5 is a standalone phase because it builds only on infrastructure shipped in v1.3 and is the first git capability needing a genuinely new git command rather than another view over the existing log/graph pipeline.

### v1.4 P6 Visual regression testing across pages and modules
No pixel comparison exists in the repo today; tests/ui/ (248 tests, real WebKit, real built bundle, both wire planes mocked) asserts DOM, geometry and computed styles.
The only screenshot in tests/ui/ is mode-switch.spec.ts's ink measurement (P22 D5), which decodes a PNG and counts ink, with no baseline image.
apps/kira-studio-vscode/tests/layout asserts real getBoundingClientRect() box heights, the answer G16 landed after a shipped build rendered a graph panel visually collapsed to ~75px while its aria-rowcount stayed correct and every check passed.
--kira-font-ui is a system-font stack (-apple-system, Segoe UI, Ubuntu, …) that resolves to a different real face on a macOS dev machine than on the Linux CI runner, so a baseline from one machine is not assertable on another until fonts are pinned.
--kira-font-data is user-customizable by design (P26 D3).
tests/ui/ runs WebKit (WKWebView on macOS, WebKitGTK on Linux) while the extension tier runs Chromium, so two rasterizers are already in play.
theme/primitives.css carries at least one infinite animation. A pixel baseline needs frozen animation, pinned fonts and a fixed renderer before it can be asserted across machines; speed and reliability pull against each other there.
Playwright's toHaveScreenshot costs no new dependency, keeps baselines in-repo and supports per-platform snapshot suffixes, but makes every developer machine a baseline authority.
A dedicated visual-diff service normalizes across platforms and brings a review UI, but is a hosted tier that CLAUDE.md's fully-open-source rule constrains hard.
The visual regression tool and approach are not decided in the roadmap; P6's own Opus planning pass picks one, together with containment measures and which surfaces get baselines.
P6 is scheduled last so it baselines a tree P1-P5 have already changed rather than one they would immediately invalidate.
P1 is P6's real precondition: a pixel tier's affordable size depends on what the suites already cost, and P1 is the phase that measures that.

### v1.4 P7 Git graph polish: row/bullet geometry, uncommitted-work click-through, file-tree icon colors
Every commit row in the git graph (packages/git-ui) has a fixed 36px height, set by --kv-row-height in theme/density.css as a single SlickGrid-wide option.
CommitGrid.vue's .kv-cell-message CSS grid unconditionally reserves both the 16px ref/PR-badge track and the 18px subject track, so undecorated commits get the same height as decorated ones.
The graph node's y-coordinate in rowSvg.ts (planNode/edgeCommand) is cy = rowHeight / 2, centering on the fixed row total rather than the subject line.
Target design for the graph: only a row with a ref/PR badge should be two lines tall, and every row's bullet should align to its own commit-message line rather than the row midpoint.
The installed SlickGrid fork (5.20.0) ships enableVariableRowHeight/ItemMetadata.height, unused in this repo (getItemMetadata returns only cssClasses), and density.css has an unused --kv-row-height-compact: 20px token; P7 builds on these.
UncommittedChangesStrip.vue is a pinned, deliberately non-interactive strip above the grid (role="status", no click handler).
A GitLens-style pseudo-row for uncommitted changes inside the graph was rejected in v1 because it would need a ~25-site grid-row-index-to-store-row-index remapping; this constraint still holds.
A click action on the uncommitted strip was deferred in v1 because it needed a sha-shaped IPC method, which "uncommitted" lacks; P7 makes the strip focusable and clickable and adds the IPC method working.detail.
working.detail composes git status's untracked entries with a plain git diff --numstat/--name-status HEAD into the same FileChange[] shape commit.detail produces; it must never use diff-tree, which cannot reach the working tree.
Because working.detail returns the commit.detail FileChange[] shape, the existing FileTree.vue rendering needs no new component logic, only a new pane variant and a third selection state alongside commit/stash.
FileTree.vue's setiIconFor (icons/setiFileIcon.ts) wraps the seti-icons@0.0.4 npm package, whose bundled definitions.json is a stale upstream snapshot.
The stale seti package renders .test.ts/.spec.ts/.test.tsx/.spec.tsx yellow (#cbcb41), whereas VS Code's seti theme (vs-seti-icon-theme.json) renders them orange (#e37933); this is the color fix.
VS Code maps .spec.cjs/.test.cjs/.spec.mjs/.test.mjs to seti icons but the stale seti-icons package has no entry for them; all other mappings already match VS Code.
The three P7 items (row geometry, uncommitted click-through, seti icon colors) are independent and bundled only because they came from the same graph-surface review pass.
<!-- /chapter v1.4 -->

<!-- chapter v1.5 -->
## v1.5
Source: docs/v1.5/ at bd0c224688d9. 14 phases.
v1.5 is the code intelligence chapter: a fourth top-level subsystem beside studio, api and the headless git module, providing a native, read-only, VS Code-like workspace per imported repository.
The v1.5 workspace includes a filesystem project tree, tabs with preview/permanent/pinned behavior, Monaco-backed file/diff viewing, in-file and repository-wide Go-native search, quick-open, and tree-sitter-derived go-to-definition/implementation.
The v1.3 git graph is mounted as the workspace's own pinned first tab instead of living only in the separately-installed VS Code extension.
v1.5 includes a local MCP server that exposes the same code graph to an AI client.
The graph's code-review layer (inline AI-feedback gutter icons, comment threads over a diff) is deferred to the chapter's last phase, and its placement in the workspace is resolved then.
The v1.5 chapter uses a fresh phase prefix (C1, C2, …) rather than continuing v1.4's P numbering, because like v1.3's git chapter it is one cohesive subsystem; C stands for code.
v1.4 shipped six independent reliability/tooling/feature phases, specified in docs/v1.4/SPEC.md.
Tabs carry a workspace key through a workspaceKeyOf(tab) derivation on TabRecord, rather than through a second AppMode value.
Entries in the issues file are closed in place (status flips to Fixed, commit noted) rather than deleted.

### v1.5 C1 Tree-sitter parsing pipeline, cached in SQLite
Phase v1.5 C1 parses a repository's source files with tree-sitter and persists the trees and symbol tables in a SQLite cache.
The parse cache is keyed so that both a later phase's graph build and a live editor's incremental reparse read from it.
Grammars in scope: Java, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript (and TSX), Go, Rust, plus JSON and HTML, and CSS as the necessary companion of HTML, Vue and Svelte.
React (JSX/TSX) has no separate grammar: the JS/TS grammar covers it, plus AST-level component/hook conventions that the graph phase reads.
Vue .vue single-file components use their own block-based tree-sitter grammar; template, script and style blocks are each reparsed with their own grammar.
Svelte .svelte files have the same SFC shape as Vue.
Angular needs no grammar beyond TypeScript plus HTML: it is TypeScript decorators plus inline or external HTML templates.
File-save events already flow through internal/gitclient's repo watcher (fsevents on darwin, fsnotify elsewhere) for git-status purposes.
The C1 planning pass must decide whether the parse cache subscribes to the existing gitclient watcher or needs its own, and how a tree-sitter incremental byte-range edit maps onto the watcher's coarser change-set.
The C1 planning pass must choose the SQLite layout (new kira.db tables or a dedicated cache database) and the Go tree-sitter binding.
Tree-sitter grammars are C, so a cgo-free Go binding is not guaranteed for every listed language; the app prefers pure-Go drivers where one exists and a justified exception where not, and the plan must state what it found and what it costs.
C1 is the foundation for C2's graph, C3's MCP server and C5's Monaco definition provider, which all read parse output; fixing the cache/reparse contract first avoids each phase inventing its own.

### v1.5 C2 Code graph: go-to-definition, go-to-implementation, find references
C2 (v1.5) builds a navigable code graph over C1's parsed symbol tables, with per-file declarations and references resolved and linked across files within a repository.
C2 exposes a query surface of definitionOf(file, position), implementationsOf(...) and referencesTo(...), called by both the MCP server (C3) and the in-app editor (C6).
C2's scope matches C1's grammar list.
Framework-specific resolution rules (Vue SFC script setup bindings into template, React component/hook references, Angular decorators wiring a template to a class) are C2's own design surface.
C2's planning pass must state which framework constructs get real cross-block resolution and which stay at the plain-symbol level tree-sitter alone gives for a first pass, and say plainly where it draws that line.
Listing "support" for a framework in the user's ask does not obligate C2 to build every framework-specific inference it theoretically could.
The C2 code graph is persisted in the same SQLite cache C1 established and is invalidated incrementally on the same reparse signal.
C2 is its own phase because graph construction and resolution is the genuinely novel algorithmic piece of the chapter; this isolates it from C1's parsing mechanics and C5/C6's editor wiring so each phase's plan is reviewable alone.

### v1.5 C3 MCP repository-map server
The v1.5 C3 MCP repository-map server is a local MCP server exposing C2's code graph (definitions, references, implementations, symbol/file search) as tools an AI client calls instead of reading whole files, to reduce token usage.
The MCP repository-map server is disabled by default.
The settings surface has an enable toggle that, once on, shows the exact CLI command to register the server with the Claude Code CLI before an Install button next to it, so enabling is never a silent action.
Registering the MCP server as a VS Code extension's MCP server gets the same treatment: command shown first, then an install action.
The MCP server runs headless via a bun run script in this repo's own package.json, matching every other dev/build/test entry point.
Write the MCP server so running it during this repo's development never collides with the dev server, the git socket, or any port/file lock that wails3 task dev holds.
In the C3 planning pass, state the concrete isolation mechanism (a distinct port/socket, a lock file, or a design needing neither) rather than asserting non-interference without one.
The MCP server reads the same SQLite cache that C1/C2 populate, with no second parse pipeline.
C3 was moved up to follow C2 because it depends only on C2, never on Monaco, search, quick-open, or the native git graph (C5 onward), so its value (whether it cuts token usage on a real task) can be measured right after C2.

### v1.5 C4 CLAUDE.md: document the repository-map MCP server for this repo's own development
CLAUDE.md must include a section naming the C3 repository-map MCP server and explaining how a session working in this repo enables and configures it.
Enabling the repository-map MCP server is expected practice for development in this repo; CLAUDE.md says so to make the shipped capability discoverable to the next session.
The C4 CLAUDE.md documentation is written right after C3, because it documents C3's real shape rather than a planned one.
CLAUDE.md contains the rule "prune as you go, don't just append", which favors documenting once the thing documented is real.

### v1.5 C5 Native code-viewing workspace, shell and viewer: repo import, tabs, project tree, Monaco file viewer — read-only thro...
An imported git repository is stored as a parallel code_repos entry, listed in the same panel as database connections (ProjectPanel.vue's "Connections" list), not as an extension of ConnectionSummary.
Clicking an imported repo opens it as its own independent workspace with its own tab set, never interleaved with another open repo's tabs or with the shared strip of studio/api.
Per-repo tab isolation is a new workspaceId dimension on TabRecord, not a second AppMode value, so studio/api behave byte-identically to today.
In the code workspace, a single click opens a file into one shared, replaceable preview slot (VS Code-style preview tab); a double-click promotes it to a permanent tab that survives the next preview open.
The first tab of a repo workspace is permanently pinned, unclosable and un-reorderable, reserved for the git graph (C10); C5 builds the pinning mechanism and a placeholder view, and C10 replaces it with the real graph.
The repo project tree lists every tracked or untracked-but-not-ignored file in the repository and opens any of them into a tab; it is a new tree, not ProjectTree.vue, which is schema-object-specific.
monaco-editor (new dependency) is the file viewer, with its bundled language-service workers (editor, typescript, json, css, html) disabled, used strictly as a renderer with Monarch tokenizers for highlighting; definition/hover extension points are reserved for C6 to wire.
The Monaco viewer is always readOnly: true, and no tab in the code workspace ever gains dirty-state, save or commit machinery; the definition tab kind's no-badge shape is the precedent to mirror.
C6's diff tabs and navigation, C7's search results, C9's quick-open, C10's graph and C11's review layer all open into the C5 workspace, so per-repo tab isolation is resolved in C5 to avoid each later phase inventing its own.
C5 was split from a larger C5 because repo import plus tab isolation and Monaco integration were too much for one implementation pass; this half is usable on its own (import a repo, browse its tree, view a file, read-only).
A result click from search (C7) is wired into C5's workspace as a preview tab.

### v1.5 C6 Diff tabs and code navigation
v1.5 C6 covers Monaco's diff-editor as its own read-only tab (worktree-vs-HEAD from a file's changed status, opened from C5's project tree).
C6 was split out of the original single C5 phase during that phase's planning pass.
C6 includes the per-repository codeindex open/sync/watch lifecycle, reusing C1's per-repository sync lock so the desktop app and a headless bun run mcp:repo-map instance never parse one repository twice.
C6 wires Monaco's definition-provider and hover extension points to C2's codegraph package, including the byte-offset-to-UTF-16-column conversion that C1's plan assigned to this later phase.
A cross-file jump in C6 opens its target as a preview tab in C5's workspace.
C6 is kept as its own row, plan and verification pass, with its own commit history and test pass against a shell C5 has already proven correct, because its failure modes (worker/bundler/provider-registration) are unrelated to C5's shared tab-state rewrite.
C6 is sequenced right after C5.

### v1.5 C7 Search: in-file and repository-wide, Go-native
Phase v1.5 C7 provides two search surfaces: in-file search using Monaco's own find widget scoped to the open buffer, and a repository-wide search panel implemented in Go.
Never use a ripgrep subprocess for repository-wide search; it must be Go-native, per explicit correction.
C7's plan chooses between a hand-rolled walk-and-scan (reusing C1's or C9's file-enumeration source, bufio plus stdlib regexp/substring matching, run concurrently across files) and a well-maintained pure-Go search library; hand-rolled is chosen only if it clears CLAUDE.md's library-reuse bar on its own merits.
The C7 plan must state which search implementation was chosen and why, as C1 did for its tree-sitter binding choice.
Stream repository search matches as they arrive instead of buffering a whole run, because every operation exceeding ~150ms must show progress.
Clicking a search match opens the file into C5's workspace as a preview tab, following the convention C5 establishes.
C7 search is text-based, not symbol-based, so it is independent of C2's graph, but it depends on C5 existing as the place results open into.

### v1.5 C8 Repo-map MCP: source-line context on results
Phase C8 adds the literal source line at each hit's position to the rendered output of find_definition, find_references, find_implementations and search_symbols in the Repo-map MCP.
outline_file's per-node lines are unchanged by C8 (no source line per node), because it is capped at 500 nodes and a source line per node would multiply the size of a response whose value is compactness.
Since C3 the server never reads file bytes (render.go's comment says so); responses derive from codegraph's indexed metadata (positions, kinds, names). C8 crosses this boundary by reading source lines, read-only.
C8 requires that a source line read from a file changed since the last codeindex sync be labeled stale, never silently presented as current.
C8 requires a per-line length cap so one very long source line cannot blow up an otherwise compact response.
C8's planning pass decides how a line is read (one open-plus-seek per hit, or something cheaper).
C8 was motivated by C7's A/B-test dogfooding: Arm A's MCP-assisted work needed an outline_file/find_definition call plus a follow-up Read of the same file to see the signature text, a two-call pattern Aider's repo-map avoids by showing the definition line verbatim.
C7's A/B-test implementation stage should be re-run against the improved server after C8 before treating the first-round numbers as final, so C8 lands now rather than at the chapter's end.

### v1.5 C9 Quick Open: fuzzy file search (Cmd+P)
C9 (v1.5) is Quick Open, a fuzzy file search bound to Cmd+P, in the style of a command palette.
Quick Open searches the open repository's tracked and untracked-but-not-ignored files.
Quick Open opens the chosen file into C5's workspace as a preview tab, the same open convention C7's search results use.
The existing fuzzy-match precedent is frontend/src/shortcuts/CommandPalette.vue, which matches commands, not files; C9 should either reuse it or deliberately decline it.
C9's planning pass must state which existing file-listing source it reads from: C5's project tree listing or the repository listing C1's parse pipeline already enumerates. Reusing one avoids a second file-enumeration mechanism if its shape fits.
C9 depends on C1's file enumeration and C5's file-opening. It is sequenced last among the editor-surface phases because it is the thinnest of the three and benefits most from the others being in place.

### v1.5 C10 Git graph mounted natively, pinned per repo
Phase C10 mounts packages/git-ui's existing graph natively, reusing the exact same Vue components as the VS Code extension (CommitGrid.vue, graph/rowSvg/layout.worker geometry engine, branch/tag/stash/worktree/stack panels, search, undo) with no reimplementation.
The native git graph mounts into the permanently pinned first tab that C5 reserved in every repository workspace, replacing C5's placeholder, except the code-review layer, which is deferred to C11.
File opens from the graph route into C5's Monaco viewer as new tabs; diff opens route through C6's diff-tab mechanism as new tabs, instead of VS Code's native editor.
Keep the native git graph read-only: disable or hide git-ui's stage/unstage, commit, discard and undo write actions, because reusing a component does not mean reusing its write affordances.
git-ui's bridge/client.ts currently assumes the extension's transport shape: a paired client token over git.sock, per git_clients' trust-store design (G1).
The native app's queries to its own backend need the same internal/gitrpc handler table but not the paired-client authentication that gates an external VS Code process; C10's plan must decide between a second in-process transport and the existing socket reused with a self-trusted client.
C10 is sequenced after C5 (tab/workspace shell and pinned-tab mechanism) and C6 (diff-tab mechanism); C2/C9 are optional inputs, so C10 can land once C5+C6 are ready even if C2/C7/C9 slip.

### v1.5 C11 Code-review layer ported natively (last feature phase)
v1.5 C11 ports packages/git-ui components/review/ and state/review*.ts into the native workspace established by C10, reusing the exact same Vue components the extension uses.
The code-review layer covers inline comment threads over a diff, AI-review feedback shown via gutter icons on affected lines, and a PR-review workflow.
The review layer depends on the graph, C5's Monaco viewer, C6's diff view (renders what a comment thread anchors to) and C2's navigation already being in place and proven.
Where the review layer's panel lives in the native workspace (own tab, side panel beside the diff, or other) is an open design question; the plan must state what it tried and why it landed where it did.
Gutter-icon anchoring uses Monaco's own decoration/glyph-margin extension points against a diff view's line mapping; no comment-anchoring-over-Monaco precedent exists in this repo, so it is this phase's own design surface.
In the extension, apps/kira-studio-vscode/src/reviewView.ts, reviewComments.ts, reviewRanges.ts and reviewMarking.ts host the review surface; the C11 plan must state what changes versus that.
The review surface in the native workspace is read-only: it views and reacts to review feedback and never writes code.
C11 is the last among feature phases, because the mounted graph, native diff viewer, navigation and gutter/decoration wiring are safer to build against once proven than co-developed.

### v1.5 C12 Code review, round 1
Code review runs once chapters C1-C11 are complete, using three Opus subagents in parallel, one per dimension, each reporting findings only and never fixing.
The three code review dimensions are: architecture/structure/maintainability/security; functional correctness/business logic; performance/resource efficiency.
Code review scope is the full diff the chapter introduces (branch base to tip) as the primary target; a reviewer that notices a real issue outside the diff, in a file the chapter touches or adjacent to one, reports and fixes it too.
After review, one sequential Sonnet subagent fixes every finding, in parallel only for a batch genuinely isolated from another, and commits each fix individually.
No findings document survives a code review round once fixed; the commit log is the record.
Run the code review round once the chapter's feature work is otherwise done, because it is a standing instruction, not a one-off request, even though CLAUDE.md's trigger is "on request".

### v1.5 C13 Code review, round 2
On repeated review rounds, if a dimension finds nothing real, state so plainly instead of manufacturing a finding (CLAUDE.md rule).
CLAUDE.md says multiple review passes means repeating the whole loop.
Code review round 2 (C13) repeats the three-dimension review plus fix cycle as a fresh reading of the tree as C12's fixes left it, not a rerun against C12's summary.

### v1.5 C14 Code review, round 3 (fable reviewers)
In v1.5 C14 (code review round 3), the three parallel reviewing subagents run on the fable model instead of Opus, per explicit instruction. Structure and scope match C12/C13 (same three dimensions).
C14 is a differently-modeled reviewer pass over a tree that two Opus rounds already reviewed, because a different reviewer model is expected to surface different findings.
The fix step in C14 stays a Sonnet subagent, unchanged from C12/C13.
Review rounds are ordered with two same-model rounds first, to converge on what one reviewer model consistently catches, then one differently-modeled round last, to check what that model misses.
<!-- /chapter v1.5 -->

<!-- chapter v1.6 -->
## v1.6
Source: docs/v1.6/ at bd0c224688d9. 23 phases.
The v1.6 chapter has six independent phases across existing modules: editor consolidation (CodeMirror removed, Monaco everywhere), a dependency/runtime upgrade, a native git-blame widget, an S3/Redis browse-panel rework, an unsigned-app update-availability banner, and foreign-key-preview edit mode.
The v1.6 chapter continues P numbering (P60+) rather than taking a fresh letter, as v1.1, v1.2 and v1.4 did, because its phases are unrelated rather than one subsystem.
v1.5 shipped code intelligence as one cohesive chapter, specified in docs/v1.5/SPEC.md (C1-C14).
Entries are closed in place (status flips to Fixed, commit noted) rather than deleted.
Code-intelligence tools reject a wrong argument name with a schema-validation error; for example outline_file rejects path as an unexpected additional property, and the real parameter is file.
Read the server port from startup output rather than assuming the documented 8765, because the server may pick another port.
Code-intelligence lookups wait out an in-flight rescan instead of answering from a mid-rebuild index, and report that the index is not ready when the initial sync has not completed, rather than returning an empty result or "no symbol found".
On cross-language name collisions, find_definition and related lookups report every hit rather than the first, and rank the referring file's own language first.
The repo derives most of its shared domain types across languages, so cross-language name collisions have real impact; outline_file on packages/shared/domain/tree.ts returns 23 nodes after the fix rather than 7.

### v1.6 P60 Editor consolidation: remove CodeMirror, Monaco everywhere
Phase P60 (v1.6) removes all @codemirror/* packages (autocomplete, commands, lang-json, lang-sql, lang-xml, language, lint, merge, state, view) and replaces every surface that uses them with Monaco.
Monaco was already brought into the app in v1.5 for the native code workspace: lazy-load pattern in apps/kira-studio/frontend/src/views/repo/monaco.ts, language registration in language.ts.
CodeMirror is used via shared editor/CodeMirrorHost.vue (supported by editor/{theme,languages,wrapSelection,findRanges,hover,diagnostics,variableHighlight}.ts), mounted by the SQL query console (views/console/*) and by project/SchemaDialog.vue's DDL editor.
The console files sqlLanguageService.ts, completion.ts, sqlHover.ts, sqlDiagnostics.ts, ddl.ts and lezerNodes.ts reference Lezer/CodeMirror-specific APIs.
A diff/merge view probably exists elsewhere on CodeMirror (since @codemirror/merge is a dependency), even though Monaco already owns diff rendering in the repo workspace (v1.5 C6); P60's planning pass must find every such site.
Each CodeMirror site must have its capabilities replaced in Monaco: SQL-aware autocomplete over live schema metadata (state/schemaColumns.ts), lint/diagnostics, DDL-document completion, hover, and whatever the merge view provides.
P60 does not ship until every listed capability has a working Monaco equivalent verified feature-by-feature, not merely that the editor renders.
P60 is scheduled first in the chapter because it is the largest, most cross-cutting change, and later phases (e.g. P67, whose cell editor may be CodeMirror-based) should build on a final single-engine editing surface.

### v1.6 P61 Dependency and runtime upgrade
Phase v1.6 P61 upgrades the toolchain and every major dependency to their current latest stable versions.
The root go.mod uses Go 1.27.0, and Wails is pinned to the pre-release github.com/wailsapp/wails/v3 v3.0.0-beta.16, a beta dependency the whole app builds on.
The Wails dependency needs explicit attention rather than a routine bump, because a Wails v3 stable release or a beta-to-beta jump can carry breaking API changes to internal/shell's own usage.
P61's planning pass builds the full current-vs-latest version inventory (Go direct dependencies, all frontend packages in the Bun workspace, Bun/Node runtime) in the plan doc, not the phase row, because a version table goes stale between planning and implementation.
The frontend packages in P61's scope include vue, the Vite/rolldown build tooling, monaco-editor, slickgrid, flatbuffers, zod, tree-sitter grammars, @vscode/codicons and fuzzysort.
Investigate any deliberate historical version pin in code comments or docs/DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md (a compatibility workaround, not mere staleness), and either resolve it or re-affirm it with its reason restated; never silently bump past it.
P61 is sequenced immediately after P60, which already changes package.json by removing a whole dependency family, so the broader bump lands on that changed tree as one deliberate pass instead of a second large independent dependency churn.

### v1.6 P62 Git blame widget in the native git module
v1.6 P62 ports git blame into the natively-embedded git module (the read-only packages/git-ui mount from v1.5 C10/C11) and is not new backend work.
v1.4 P5 already built the blame backend for the VS Code extension's status bar: internal/gitrpc's blame.line method, a porcelain-parser-backed git blame run through internal/gitclient's streaming runner, and the packages/git-ipc contract method.
blame.line is already in the read-only allowlist in v1.5's internal/bridge/gitstream.go, admitted as a pure read, so it is safe to call from the native surface.
P62's work is a native-side UI consumer of blame.line that follows C11's porting discipline: reuse packages/git-ui components/state where they exist and build only what the native embedding lacks.
P62's planning pass decides where blame surfaces in the native workspace: inline gutter annotations over Monaco (matching C11's comment-decoration precedent), a status-bar-style summary (the extension's original shape), or both.
P62 is independent of every other row in its chapter.

### v1.6 P63 Browse panels: vertical split, relocated back-navigation, clearer Redis types
P63 (browse panels: vertical split, relocated back-navigation, clearer Redis types) is planned in docs/v1.6/plans/P63-browse-split-and-redis-types.md; its implementation is deferred and lands as part of P65, behind P64 and P65 in landing order.
There is no separate S3/Redis browse panel pair: one BrowseView.vue serves both engines, joined with the separate KeyValueView.vue data-view tab via an extracted KeyValuePane.vue.
PanelSplitter, not PanelShell, is the vehicle for the P63 split.
The browse back control is already an icon (arrow-up) and becomes chevron-left, not arrow-left, because arrow-left is already this app's Previous-page glyph.
Redis type differentiation in the browse tree uses icon plus badge, not colour, modeled on RedisInsight.
Redis type differentiation requires a small backend addition, Adapter.KeyTypes, because the tree carries no type today.

### v1.6 P64 Repo-map MCP: fix the type-alias gap, investigate what else the graph can answer
In the repo-map MCP server (internal/repomap), TypeScript type aliases (every z.infer-derived domain type such as TreeNode, BrowseTabState, and every *TabRecord) are invisible to the index.
When a TypeScript type alias is missing from the index, find_definition does not error; it silently returns a same-named Go struct instead, which is a correctness bug.
CLAUDE.md's dogfooding rule requires the type-alias gap in the repo-map MCP to be closed before the next phase starts, so the fix is a hard prerequisite regardless of P65.
The repo-map MCP server has six tools: find_definition, find_references, find_implementations, search_symbols, search_files, outline_file.
A signature/pattern search over already-extracted declarations is a confirmed candidate new repo-map tool, motivated by P63's planning hunting for a function doing bulk writes with no name to search by.
A new repo-map capability earns a place only if it demonstrably reduces the tokens an implementing agent spends getting an answer it would otherwise reach a slower or larger-context way; it must not be added for completeness or IDE-feature symmetry.
For each proposed repo-map capability, the planning pass must state what token cost it removes and how that claim is checked.
The type-alias fix lands between P63's plan and its implementation so that P65's A/B measurement measures the tool in the state a real user would have it, not a known-incomplete one.

### v1.6 P64b Repo-map MCP: close the same alias/constant gap in Go and plain JavaScript
P64's fix (typescript/p64_declarations.scm and tsx/p64_declarations.scm) closed the missing-capture defect for TypeScript only; the same defect class exists in Go and plain JavaScript.
In go/tags.scm, the const_declaration/var_declaration patterns capture a bare @name with no @definition.x wrapper, so top-level Go const/var produce no symbol row at all.
extract.go's code comment states that a capture with neither a definition. nor reference. prefix produces nothing.
Go type coverage is healthy, with a 1274-symbol baseline that P64's plan used for comparison.
javascript/tags.scm captures arrow/function-valued const/let/var as @definition.function by design, but a non-function top-level const/let such as export const CONFIG is captured only via a narrow CommonJS-shaped export_statement value assignment_expression pattern, not ESM's export const form.
HTML, CSS, JSON and Svelte are correctly symbol-free by design, because a CSS selector or a JSON key is not a definition anything resolves to (per the symbolLanguages comment in languages.go).
Rust already captures its type-like declarations, bucketed under @definition.class; this is a labeling quirk, not a missing capture.
Python and Java are out of scope for P64b; Java's missing-enum gap is logged separately and deferred.
P64b's planning pass confirms exact scope against the live query files and codeindex.db as P64's did, and measures how much of this repository's own .js/.go source is affected before committing to the fix's shape.
P64b gets its own row rather than reopening P64's approved plan, and is sequenced before P65 so the A/B measurement reflects the tool's fully current state.

### v1.6 P64c Repo-map MCP: make a full parse-from-scratch fast
P64c target: a full parse of a repository of about 1800 files, from nothing, takes seconds, regardless of what triggers it.
The repo-map MCP server's documented baseline for a full index of about 1800 files is about 30s.
P64c scope is the raw throughput of the parse-and-write pipeline; how often a full reparse is triggered (e.g. a query-file edit forcing truncate-and-reparse) is out of scope, as a dev-only, low-frequency cost.
P64c must investigate whether file parsing can be parallelized across goroutines without breaking codeindex's per-repo write ordering.
P64c must investigate whether SQLite writes are batched into transactions or issued one at a time, and whether the watcher/sync-writer lock contention is structural or a one-off from running several repo-map instances in one container.
The slow full index observed during P64b was one genuinely single-threaded parse-and-write pass (no deadlock, no infinite loop), with SQLITE_BUSY "database is locked" errors from the fsnotify watcher and the sync writer contending for the same SQLite file.
More goroutines is only one plausible lever for P64c, not the presumed answer; the planning pass must profile the actual pipeline (time and lock contention) before proposing a fix, per CLAUDE.md's "measure when there's a real, concrete question at stake".
A first-ever index of a brand-new repository pays the same full-parse cost, so P64c speeds up a real user's first run, not just dev convenience.
P64c is sequenced before P65 so the A/B measurement's "with MCP" arm reflects a server that is fast to (re)index.

### v1.6 P65 A/B measurement: implement P63 with and without the repo-map MCP server
Phase P65 implements P63's approved plan twice from the identical starting commit, in two isolated worktrees: one Sonnet subagent using the repo-map MCP server (with P64's improvements) as CLAUDE.md instructs, and one using Grep/Read only.
In P65 both arms implement to real shipping quality so the comparison is fair.
The MCP-using arm's implementation is the real one and lands as P63's actual deliverable on v1.6; the non-MCP arm is a throwaway baseline discarded after comparison.
P65's deliverable beyond the shipped feature is the measurement: total tokens and tool-call counts for each arm, reported plainly, replacing the repo-map MCP section's asserted-but-never-measured savings claim with a real number.
P65 requires P63's plan and P64's improved, corrected tool to have landed first, so the with-MCP arm reflects the tool's real current capability.

### v1.6 P66 Update-availability banner (no silent auto-update)
The app is distributed unsigned, so a real auto-download-and-install update mechanism is not viable; P66 uses an update-availability banner with no silent auto-update.
P66 fetches the latest GitHub release for this repository and compares it against the running app's version from internal/buildinfo, which already holds build/version metadata.
Only when a newer release exists, a status bar banner appears; clicking it opens the GitHub releases page in the user's OS-default browser.
The status bar is an existing UI region, referenced in TitleBar.vue, WorkbenchShell.vue and SettingsDialog.vue.
Public release metadata needs no per-user credential, so an anonymous list-releases call suffices; internal/ghclient is already used by the git module's commit.resolvePr/branch.resolvePr.
P66 is independent of every other row.

### v1.6 P67 Cell editor: enter edit mode for a foreign-key preview's related record
P67 (v1.6) extends the FK preview in the cell editor so it opens the related record in a real edit session, not only a read-only preview.
Clicking a foreign-key-valued cell already shows the referenced row from its own table; the component is likely views/shared/celleditor/CellEditorView.vue or adjacent.
P67 design: route the FK preview into the existing row-edit surface, pointed at the related table/row, reusing it rather than building a second edit UI.
P67 is sequenced after P60, so the cell editor is already Monaco-based; P67 builds on that end state. P67 is independent of every other feature row.

### v1.6 P67b Git module: peer top-level module, graph/loading fixes, file-tree icon parity
Phase P67b makes Git a peer top-level module alongside Studio and Api, each self-contained, with repositories switched inside the Git module.
A repo does not displace the studio/api switcher; it already sits beside it as a fourth-plus top-level tab.
The real complaint behind P67b: a repository (an instance) is a top-level peer of modules, and the repo list lives inside Studio's Connections panel.
P67b fixes a bug where the graph and review tab went blank after opening a file, because a shared transport's owner disposed a socket other mounts still held a reference to.
P67b fixes a bug where a cold start needed a manual Retry, because a stream send raced the socket's own open event.
P67b ports file-tree icons verbatim from the diff tree's own icon rule, for icon parity.
The read-only-relaxation piece of the original finding was split out of P67b into P67e.
The P67b plan lives at docs/v1.6/plans/P67b-git-module-peer-nav.md, and the phase is independent of every other row.

### v1.6 P67e Git module: relax read-only for pull/fetch/merge/rebase/push, add the native credential prompt
P67e admits every mutating git operation that writes through git itself rather than an in-app file edit, including all op.run/remote.run kinds (fetch, pull, push, force-push, undo, restack); before it, the native git module is read-only.
P67e keeps refused the operations that need something the app lacks: conflict resolution, a worktree prepare script's arbitrary shell execution, opening a worktree window, and setting the global git path.
A conflicting merge/rebase must surface the conflict state plainly through the existing conflict banner, widened so Continue/Skip/Abort work, rather than attempt a resolution the app can't offer.
P67e builds a native credential prompt for HTTPS auth, because nothing native answers credential.request today.
P67e's planning pass re-verifies P67b's §5 research (docs/v1.6/plans/P67b-git-module-peer-nav.md) against the tree P67b lands, since line numbers and some files move.
P67e needs P67b landed first because it shares hostHandlers.ts's capability-flag literal and is easier to verify on the finished nav reorg tree.

### v1.6 P67f Repo-map MCP: distinguish "not yet indexed" from "genuinely absent"; fix `find_references` missing range/index-expres...
Against a cold index, repo-map MCP search_symbols answered "no symbols matching" for an existing symbol (readOnlyMethods, internal/bridge/gitstream.go:70), then answered correctly about 90 seconds later with no restart.
internal/repomap/render.go:140 renders the identical string for "the index has not caught up yet" and "this symbol does not exist", and nothing in internal/repomap exposes sync state an MCP client could check first.
Repo-map MCP find_references returns nothing, even on a warm index, for a package-level variable whose only reads are via range or an index expression (reproduced with allowedMethods, allowedStreamMethods, writeMethods, hostAnsweredMethods).
The find_references range/index-expression gap is logged in docs/v1.6/mcp-repo-map-issues.md and is likely a tags.scm pattern gap, the same defect class as P64/P64b but on the reference side rather than the definition side.
The server already tracks sync-in-progress state internally (a watcher/writer state used for its own logging, from P64c's throughput work); P67f plans to surface it either as a distinct "still indexing" response shape or a tools/list-visible sync-status tool, whichever costs an implementing agent fewer tokens.
Fix non-trivial dogfooding findings in a dedicated pass before the next phase starts; do not let them ride along unfixed (as P63's finding forced P64), per CLAUDE.md.

### v1.6 P67c Monaco theming/highlighting fixes, app-wide checkbox styling, markdown reading view
Phase v1.6 P67c bundles Monaco theming/highlighting fixes, app-wide checkbox styling, and a markdown reading view into one phase, at the user's request.
Monaco syntax highlighting is inconsistent: package.json and TypeScript decorators are not highlighted properly; the planning pass must find every language-registration gap behind these (likely views/repo/language.ts or monacoEntry.ts), not just the two reported cases.
Monaco's right-click context menu and autocomplete widget render unthemed across most Monaco panels (transparent background, black text); the fix is to use Monaco's editor.defineTheme API, already used elsewhere in the app, rather than default browser-native popup styling.
Checkbox styling is broken app-wide; the fix is to locate the shared checkbox primitive/CSS and fix it in that one place.
For markdown files, a button toggles a rendered, reading-formatted view (rendered Markdown, not a code formatter) alongside the existing raw/code view.
Phase P67c is independent of every other row in the plan.

### v1.6 P67d Repo-map MCP settings toggle: general enablement, per-repo access
The Settings dialog's Code intelligence tab is the product surface for the repo-map MCP toggle, distinct from the dev-only headless server that CLAUDE.md's own section covers.
The repo-map MCP toggle fails with "no repository found for this working directory" because it is scoped to a single working directory, not app-wide.
P67d makes the repo-map MCP toggle general: enabling it starts the server with no working-directory requirement, lists every repo the app has imported/opened, and lets the user grant or revoke MCP access per repo.

### v1.6 P68 Code review, round 1
P68 code review round 1 uses three parallel Opus subagents, one per dimension: architecture/security, functional correctness, performance/resource efficiency. They produce findings only, per CLAUDE.md's own process.
After the P68 review, one sequential Sonnet subagent fixes every finding judged real.
P68 code review runs only after every feature row (P60-P67, P67b-P67f) has landed, because a review needs a finished tree.
A final row (P70) updates this repository's main docs.

### v1.6 P68b Repo-map MCP: fix `outline_file`'s absent-file vs. no-definitions ambiguity
In the repo-map MCP, outline_file renders the identical sentence "%s has no indexed definitions" (render.go:181) for both an indexed file with no definitions and a nonexistent path, so an agent cannot tell a typo'd path from a definition-free file.
In the repo-map MCP, search_files already answers whether a path exists, and sourceForOneFile already distinguishes file not found from unreadable for its source-line reads.
Phase P68b wires the file-not-found vs. unreadable distinction (as in sourceForOneFile) into outline_file to resolve the absent-file vs. no-definitions ambiguity.
The outline_file ambiguity was found during P68's dimension-1 review by calling the tool rather than reading source, and is logged in docs/v1.6/mcp-repo-map-issues.md under Non-trivial per CLAUDE.md's rule.
Close a non-trivial dogfooding finding before the next phase starts, because CLAUDE.md requires it; the outline_file finding therefore gates P69, not P68's fix pass, which covers only ordinary review findings.

### v1.6 P69 Code review, round 2
Code review round 2 (P69) reruns the same three-dimension review cycle in full on the tree that P68 and P68b leave; it is not optional, per CLAUDE.md's rule to repeat the whole loop that many times.
When a code review round finds nothing real, say so instead of manufacturing a finding.

### v1.6 P69b Repo-map MCP: capture a package-level constant/variable read as a plain argument/operand identifier
Repo-map MCP find_references returns "no references found" for a package-level constant or variable read as a plain identifier in argument or comparison/arithmetic-operand position, the commonest way such a name is read.
P67f's fix (ddd15b00/0bfef238) covered only range-clause and index-expression reads, so P69b is a narrower survivor of the same defect class, reproduced on six real names across Go and TypeScript.
P69b is logged in docs/v1.6/mcp-repo-map-issues.md under Non-trivial.
P69b's planning pass must measure the row-count growth of the new bare-identifier capture before shipping, because locals and parameters will dominate it and insertRef is already most of the write phase (per P64c's measurement), so index size and throughput are a concern.
CLAUDE.md requires a non-trivial dogfooding finding to be closed before the next phase starts, so P69b gates P70 but not P69's own fix pass, as P68b gated P69 rather than P68.

### v1.6 P69c `codeparse`: cancelling a parse mid-flight still crashes the process (C assertion, not the earlier SIGSEGV)
Cancelling a parse mid-flight in codeparse still crashes the process: TestParseConcurrentCancellationDoesNotCrash aborts the test binary on go-tree-sitter's C assertion 'ts_parser_parse: Assertion self->finished_tree.ptr failed' (SIGABRT), replacing the earlier SIGSEGV.
The SIGABRT stack is rooted in parseWithOptions in session.go, the function P69's commit b412286b rewrote to fix the earlier SIGSEGV; the crash mode changed but the underlying hazard (cancelling a context mid-parse) did not.
Session.Parse is the live indexing path, not test-only, so the crash reaches the shipped app: a Settings revoke or app quit racing a running index can trigger it.
P69c must find the safe cancellation boundary the go-tree-sitter C API supports; whether ParseWithOptions's progress-callback approach is unsafe to race against a concurrent cancel must be established against the library's C source, not assumed from its Go wrapper.
The P69c fix must be confirmed with the same repeated-run stress-test discipline P69's fix used to confirm the SIGSEGV was gone.
P69c is a crash-severity finding that gates P70 alongside P69b, and is sequenced after P69b lands (one phase at a time).

### v1.6 P69d Repo-map MCP: `find_references`'s `file` scoping is broken; investigate a workaround for `go-tree-sitter`'s per-parse...
In the repo-map MCP, find_references's file/line disambiguator, which the tool's own ambiguity message recommends, turns a correct answer into an empty one for at least one reproduced symbol.
In the repo-map MCP, find_references fails to filter by file/line for Parse: pinning file/line to its own definition still returns 38 unrelated hits.
In the repo-map MCP, the find_references languages filter widens its own candidate set rather than narrowing it, and accepts its values case-sensitively with no error on a bad case.
go-tree-sitter@v0.25.0's ParseWithOptions (parser.go:350, three more call sites, and query.go:788) saves its options struct into the global go-pointer registry with no matching Unref in the vendored source.
Every go-tree-sitter parse leaks one C.malloc(1) plus a permanently retained registry map entry, under a global mutex that all concurrent parses contend on.
No newer go-tree-sitter version exists to fix the pointer-registry leak upstream.
P69d investigates whether reusing one static ParseOptions/callback shape across calls can bound registry growth to a constant instead of one entry per parse, without reopening P69c's cancel-safety property.
P69d root-causes the find_references scoping bug directly against internal/repomap's resolution/filtering code, as prior repo-map fix rows in this chapter did.
Both P69c dogfooding findings are logged in docs/v1.6/mcp-repo-map-issues.md. CLAUDE.md's rule requires both closed before the next phase starts, so P69d gates P70 and is sequenced after P69c lands.

### v1.6 P69e `internal/repomap`: fix `TestDetachDrainsInFlightCall`'s pre-existing `-race` failure
TestDetachDrainsInFlightCall in internal/repomap fails under go test -race: Server.Detach spawns a goroutine that waits for in-flight callers to drain then calls close(), which reads package-level readyTimeout, while the test's deferred restore of readyTimeout can run before that goroutine finishes.
The fix for the TestDetachDrainsInFlightCall race is test-only: the test must wait for Detach's drain goroutine (via a hook or a bounded wait on an observable side effect) before its defer restores readyTimeout; no product code changes are expected.
A known-red go test -race result must not stand at chapter close, under the "no shortcuts, no TODO: fix later" bar, even when found by running the test suite rather than by a dogfooding tool call.
P69e gates P70, as every other lettered repo-map/test-suite finding in the v1.6 chapter has gated the next phase.

### v1.6 P70 Update main docs
Phase P70 updates the main docs (README.md, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md, CLAUDE.md) to be current for everything v1.5 and v1.6 changed, including v1.5's whole code-intelligence subsystem (C1-C14) and every row P60-P69e.
P70 reads each main doc against the current tree, not the SPEC.md or plans/ prose of either chapter, to find drift such as a removed dependency still documented, a new subsystem missing from ARCHITECTURE.md's component list, a stale tool count, or a resolved environment quirk.
P70 is the last row: it needs every other row landed (including both code-review rounds, P68b, P69b, P69c, P69d and P69e), and it is the one row scoped to both v1.5 and v1.6.

## v1.7
Source: docs/v1.7/ at bd0c224688d9. 10 phases.
The v1.7 chapter builds a local database MCP server with list/metadata/query tools, a per-connection permissions model, and PII anonymization filters usable over MCP and in the normal data viewer.
v1.7 phases use the letter M (MCP) instead of continuing v1.6's P numbering, because every phase builds one subsystem, as v1.5's code-intelligence chapter did with C1-C14.
M1's migration is named 0020_m1_connection_mcp.sql after rebase.
M1c root cause was two-part: Go/TS/JS field declarations were never indexed as symbols, and a plain x.Field/obj.prop read was never captured as a reference (only call-position selectors were).
The M1c fix uses a new @reference.field kind rather than reusing @reference.read, because the cross-directory tier-clamp of @reference.read would have left the original bug unfixed.
Field indexing covers Go/TS/JS but is declined for Java/Python/Rust (2 fixture files each, no real user) and for object/composite-literal keys, which are syntactically ambiguous with map literals in Go (25,490:5,493 noise ratio in TS).
extractionVersion was bumped from 3 to 4, which forces a one-time full reindex on next sync; this is expected, not a bug.
After the M1c fix, search_symbols and find_references on ConnectionFields.AutoExplain resolve correctly, with exactly 7 references.
M4 (Faker-MCP bridge) never shipped.
Closed entries are updated in place (status flips to Fixed, commit noted) rather than deleted.

### v1.7 M1 Local DB MCP server: list/metadata/query tools, 7-day rotating token
The v1.7 M1 plan (docs/v1.7/plans/M1-db-mcp-server-core.md) adds a new Go MCP server for local databases, implemented as part of M1ab.
The DB MCP server is a sibling to internal/repomap and reuses its transport pattern (go-sdk/mcp, loopback-only streamable HTTP), but has its own process, port and tool set.
The DB MCP server exposes list_connections, list_databases, list_schemas, describe_table and run_query; list_connections returns every configured connection the app knows.
Metadata tools (list_databases, list_schemas, describe_table) route through the existing apps/kira-studio/internal/adapters/* layer, with no new metadata path.
run_query executes through the same adapter query path the console UI uses.
MCP auth is a static bearer token with a 7-day expiry that rotates, built directly into internal/mcpauth (not a sibling package).
The repo-map server's currently non-expiring token gets the same 7-day rotation in internal/mcpauth, by explicit instruction, rather than a second scheme.
The M1 plan designs the expiry/rotation record shape, the rotation trigger (auto-remint on expiry vs. manual remint, possibly differing for the headless repo-map server), the lapsed-token client error, the server start/stop lifecycle, and whether to share KIRA_HOME with the repo-map server or use a distinct root.
A client presenting a lapsed token must see a distinct, actionable error, not a generic 401.
M1 is the first phase: every later phase (permissions, EXPLAIN, Faker, anonymization) extends this server's tool set or query path, so nothing else in the chapter can start before it exists.
M1's migration is renumbered 0020_m1_connection_mcp.sql after the rebase.

### v1.7 M1ab A/B measurement: implement M1 with and without the repo-map MCP server
The v1.7 M1ab phase implemented M1's approved plan twice from the identical commit b46eac88 in two isolated worktrees: arm A used the repo-map MCP server for navigation, arm B used only Grep/Read.
Arm A (MCP) is M1's real deliverable on v1.7; arm B was a throwaway baseline discarded after comparison.
M1 was chosen as the A/B candidate because it is almost entirely Go with no .vue surface, so repo-map's confirmed Vue blind spot (docs/v1.6/mcp-repo-map-issues.md) does not undercut it, and it needs broad unfamiliar-codebase navigation.
In the M1 A/B measurement, the repo-map MCP arm used more tokens (516,104 vs 451,263) and more tool calls (339 vs 332) than the Grep/Read arm, so there was no overall efficiency win on this backend-heavy phase.
Repo-map saved specific reads: outline_file on page/builder.go avoided about 10 unneeded read_symbol calls, and read_symbol sized dbmcp's consumer interfaces without reading tree.Service's 300 lines.
Report A/B token and tool-call numbers plainly whether or not they favor the tool, as v1.6 P65 did.
Arm A's run_query forced a full reconnect (live adapter torn down, cache dropped, pre-connect script re-run) on every call even for an already-connected connection, and did not surface a failed connect's own error text.
Arm A's Playwright fixtures preconnect.spec.ts and secrets.spec.ts missed the new mcpEnabled field; a follow-up sweep found further tests/ui/ specs missing it too.
Arm B never hydrated settingsState.dbMcp from persisted settings, so the Database MCP panel, including Regenerate, appears disabled and hidden after every app restart even when the server is running.
Arm A's defects were fixed on v1.7-m1ab-arm-a: reconnect churn and error surfacing in 8e2542d9 with a regression test in access_test.go, and the mcpEnabled fixture sweep across all tests/ui/ specs in 764f6e61.
The M1 work landed on v1.7 via non-fast-forward merge commit dfa45459, because v1.7 gained two doc-only commits after the worktrees branched.
The full tests/ui/ Playwright suite must run with a KIRA_DEBUG_HOOKS=1 test build; post-merge it passed 269/269 on real webkit.
Verify claims of pre-existing failures against the actual built base commit, not an arm's self-report, because a fixture failure claimed pre-existing was a real regression.

### v1.7 M1c Repo-map MCP: fix the struct-field reference/definition gap
In the repo-map MCP, find_references/search_symbols returned nothing for a Go struct field reached only via a selector expression (e.g. f.AutoExplain).
The struct-field gap had two root causes: Go/TS/JS field declarations were never indexed as symbols, and a plain x.Field/obj.prop read was never captured as a reference (only call-position selectors were).
The fix uses a new @reference.field capture kind instead of reusing @reference.read, because @reference.read's cross-directory tier-clamp would have left the original bug unfixed.
The field fix covers Go and TypeScript/JS (same defect class, P64b precedent); it is declined for Java/Python/Rust because each has only 2 fixture files and no real user.
Object/composite-literal keys are not captured as field references, because they are syntactically ambiguous with map literals in Go and had a 25,490:5,493 noise ratio in TS.
extractionVersion was bumped from 3 to 4, which forces a one-time full reindex on next sync; this is expected, not a bug.
After the fix, search_symbols/find_references on ConnectionFields.AutoExplain resolve correctly, giving exactly 7 references at exact lines.
Close the struct-field reference gap before the next phase's implementation starts, as CLAUDE.md requires (same gating as v1.6's P64/P68b/P69d/P69e fixes).

### v1.7 M2 Connection editor: MCP tab, per-operation permissions (read/write/DDL), deny/allow/prompt enforcement
v1.7 M2 adds an MCP tab to the existing tab strip in ConnectionDialog.vue; DetailTab gains a fourth value.
The MCP tab has a free-text description field ("what this DB is for"), passed to the AI client as connection metadata, likely surfaced via the response of list_connections/describe_table.
The MCP tab has three independent permission controls (read, write, DDL), each set to deny, allow or prompt.
Prompt mode means the query does not run until a human approves it, shown with the actual query text, in an approval UI (dialog or persistent queue/dock) that the phase's planning pass designs, building on existing interrupt UI such as the conflict banner precedent in v1.6's P67e row.
M2's backend extends ConnectionFields with the description and three permission-mode columns via a new migration, following the precedent of 0004_p18_auto_explain.sql.
Permission enforcement happens in M1's run_query tool handler, which classifies each statement as read, write or DDL before executing it. The planning pass decides how to classify reliably per adapter kind (SQL parse or per-kind heuristic); Mongo, Redis and S3 have no single statement shape, so it must generalize past SQL.
M2 follows M1c's gating dogfooding finding and extends M1's single query-execution tool and the connection model directly.

### v1.7 M3 EXPLAIN path over MCP: parsed responses, auto-force-explain, heavy-query flag
The MCP server exposes an explain_query tool that returns the same parsed plan structure the console UI already renders (via parseExplainPages in views/console/explain.ts and plan.ts), not a raw driver dump.
An auto-force-explain setting, per-connection or per-request, runs EXPLAIN before every run_query call on the MCP path regardless of whether the client asks for it.
When the parsed plan crosses a heaviness threshold, the query is flagged back to the human user, not silently to the AI.
The heaviness threshold is defined in this phase's planning pass, based on signals such as row-estimate, seq-scan-on-large-table and cost value that plan.ts's existing parse already exposes cheaply, extended only if genuinely needed.
M3 is scheduled right after M2 because both extend M1's query tool, and the permission gate for heavy/DDL queries should exist before EXPLAIN-gating logic is layered on top.

### v1.7 M4 Faker exposed via MCP — descoped, not built
v1.7 M4 (exposing Faker via MCP) was descoped and never built; nothing from M4 ships.
M4 was designed as a generate_fake_data tool bridging the Go MCP server to @faker-js/faker through an embedded goja JS VM; design kept as a historical record in docs/v1.7/plans/M4-faker-bridge.md.
goja was chosen over a JS subprocess because a subprocess would silently not work in a shipped binary with no JS runtime; goja output was measured byte-identical to real Bun/faker across all 24 generators.
The M4 goja bridge commits (55229696..ca8b2e02) were discarded because M5 only needs masking, not realistic fake-value replacement, so a realistic value generator has no consumer in this chapter.

### v1.7 M5 Anonymization filters: per-column PII rules, format-preserving masking, applied over MCP and in the normal data viewer
M5 adds anonymization filters with per-column PII rules (which table.column pairs are PII), configurable per connection.
M5 anonymization uses masking only, with no Faker-based realistic-value replacement (M4 was descoped for this reason).
Hashing alone was ruled out for anonymization because a low-entropy value like a first name is guessable even when hashed and salted; masking genuinely deletes characters instead of transforming them.
Masking is deterministic per real value within a connection (same input always gives the same masked output), so correlation and referential joins across a foreign key survive without exposing or allowing recovery of the real value.
Masking shape differs per PII class (name, email, numeric/date field each need a different shape); M5's planning pass designs the actual schemes.
MCP query results pass through the configured per-column filter before being returned to an AI client.
The normal data viewer (views/grid/DataView.vue grid and the celleditor/ cell editor) gets a toggle to view the masked transform live over real data; it is a display-layer transform and never mutates the underlying row.
The planned 'id' masking kind (full redact + tag for identifier-shaped columns) was dropped because masking is opt-in per column, so an identifier nobody marks sensitive is already untouched.
M5 ships five masking kinds (name, email, text, number, date) plus redact.
M5 no longer depends on M4 (descoped); it needs M2's connection model and M1's query/result path, both already landed.
The M5 filter-rule UI is likely a table within M2's MCP tab, with storage as a new table/migration; the concrete design is left to the phase's planning pass.

### v1.7 M6 Code review, round 1
v1.7 M6 code review round 1 uses three parallel Opus subagents, one per dimension: architecture/security, functional correctness, performance/resource efficiency. They produce findings only, per CLAUDE.md's process.
v1.7 M6 review scope is wider than a normal round, by explicit instruction: the chapter's own diff (M1ab, M2-M5) is the primary target, plus a dedicated pass over v1.6's diff (origin/main..v1.6's tip, P60-P70's changes), plus anything else reviewers notice in adjacent code.
After the three review subagents report, one sequential Sonnet subagent fixes every finding judged real.
The v1.7 M6 review runs only after M1ab and M2-M5 land, because a review needs a finished tree. The v1.6-focused half needs v1.6 fully landed, which is already true.

### v1.7 M7 Code review, round 2
Code review round 2 (M7) reruns the same three-dimension review cycle in full against the tree left after M6's fixes, with the same wider v1.6-focused scope, re-reading fresh rather than trusting M6's summary.
Repeat the whole review loop in full after fixes land, per CLAUDE.md.
A review round that finds nothing real must say so rather than manufacture a finding.

### v1.7 M8 Update main docs
The v1.7 M8 milestone updates README.md, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md and CLAUDE.md to cover the chapter's new subsystem: a second MCP server, its permissions/anonymization/Faker model, and its Settings-dialog toggle.
Update docs by reading the current tree, not trusting existing prose, the same bar v1.6's P70 used.
The v1.7 M8 docs update is the chapter's last milestone and must wait until both review rounds' fixes have landed.
<!-- /chapter v1.7 -->

<!-- chapter v1.8 -->
## v1.8
Source: docs/v1.8/ at bd0c224688d9. 25 phases.
The v1.8 chapter holds misc fixes and polish across two existing modules: the API client (incognito mode, input sizing) and the git module (graph rendering/perf, PR integration, diff viewing, code review UX, settings placement, branches/stashes UX, blame, worktrees).
The v1.8 chapter continues P numbering (P71+) rather than taking a fresh letter, because these are unrelated phases rather than one subsystem, as in v1.1, v1.2, v1.4 and v1.6.
v1.7 shipped the database MCP server as one cohesive chapter, specified in docs/v1.7/SPEC.md (M1-M8).
Worktree creation/switching work reuses WorktreeList.vue's existing create/switch machinery rather than adding a new dialog.

### v1.8 P71 API module: incognito mode per tab, 4-row auto-growing inputs (Landed)
The API module has no browser-local storage; apps/kira-studio/frontend/src/state/tabs.ts and api/state/* all write through the bridge to Go/SQLite.
Incognito mode is a per-tab toggle: when on, nothing from that tab's session persists after the tab closes (no history entry, no env/variable writes, no collection changes, no saved request); rendering, running requests and viewing responses work normally; the tab shows a visual incognito indicator.
Incognito is a frontend-only per-tab flag (state/tabIncognito.ts) that filters every tab snapshot before tabsSave.
The Go RPC args HttpSendArgs and GrpcCallArgs have an Incognito bool field that guards response-history recording and internal/oplog persistence; a running incognito op shows live in the Operations panel but is never written.
An incognito tab's active environment is a per-tab in-memory override and does not touch the shared active-env row.
Raw-text inputs auto-grow up to 4 rows before switching to internal scroll, via a CSS grid-replica trick (.p-input.is-grow in primitives.css) behind an opt-in grow prop on TextField.vue and AutocompleteField.vue.
The grow prop is used on params, headers, form-data and gRPC metadata cells, and deliberately not on URL/target fields, Monaco body editors, form-data's content-type cell, or VariableRow's password-type value cell.

### v1.8 P72 Git graph panel: remove repo-switch dropdown, rendering/perf/layout fixes, settings relocation
RepoPicker.vue and its AppToolbar.vue mount point were deleted because Kira Studio's left sidebar and the VS Code extension's one-repo-per-window model already make the repo-switch dropdown redundant.
The git graph's reload on tab focus was fixed by keeping RepoGraphView.vue mounted across tab switches with KeepAlive, instead of tearing down and rebuilding the whole layout.
Checkout misalignment of the git graph was fixed by keeping the graph layout on screen across a refresh instead of resetting it to zero lanes mid-stream.
Scroll flicker in the git graph was fixed by rebuilding row heights when PR badges resolve, calling invalidateRowHeights() alongside invalidateAllRows().
Widening minRowBuffer was found unnecessary once the row-height invalidation fix landed.
ResizeObserver fires reliably under KeepAlive on both Chromium and WebKit (confirmed via a standalone repro), so the fallback MountHandle.refresh() method was not added.
Branch/tag label sizing in the git graph reads off the shared --kv-* type scale so labels match adjacent commit-message text.
The dateFormat and kiraVersion.log.level repo settings moved app-wide, as appearance.dateFormat and advanced.gitLogLevel respectively.
The log.level key remains a source:'repo' schema entry because VS Code's RepoSettingsDialog.vue is its only editing surface there, host-conditional via the MountOptions.host seam; only its instanceWide cross-repo-collapse special case was deleted.
Settings relocation sits last within the git-module row so it does not relocate a setting whose look/appearance behavior the same row may have just changed; P74/P75 depend on stable graph navigation.

### v1.8 P73 Tab-strip icons and markdown reading-view font
TabKindDef.icon is widened to string | { filePath }; only the repo-file tab kind returns { filePath: tab.path }, which TabStrip.vue resolves through the same fileIconStyle() the repo file tree uses, so a file's tab icon matches its tree icon.
The repo-diff tab kind keeps the git-compare icon because it is the only glance-level diff signal given tab-title truncation.
The orphaned repoFileIcon() and its monacoLanguageFor import were deleted.
The repo-map MCP server has a confirmed false negative on non-call reads, so orphaned code is verified by grep; the issue is documented in docs/v1.8/mcp-repo-map-issues.md.
The markdown reading-view font was small not because of its base size (already tied to --kira-font-size, matching Monaco) but because fenced code inherited the :deep(code) --kira-t-sm step-down, and Tailwind preflight zeroes heading font-size with .md-reading never restoring it.
Fenced code in the markdown reading view is sized by a more-specific :deep(pre code) rule at --kira-t-md, overriding the :deep(code) --kira-t-sm step-down.
Markdown reading-view headings h1-h6 use an em-based scale (1.6/1.4/1.2/1.05/1) so they track the Appearance font-size setting rather than a literal size or --kira-t-xl.
repo-workspace.spec.ts's per-language-icon test compares a tab's .tab-file-icon mask-image to its tree row's; markdown-reading.spec.ts's Source/Reading test compares a fenced block's computed pre code font-size to a Monaco .view-line's.

### v1.8 P74 Commit detail, PR integration and diff viewing
The commit-detail 'Show more' defect was clipping: the expanded .kv-detail-pane-meta region was hard-clipped at max-height 50%, with scrollHeight exceeding clientHeight at both 300px and 800px app heights.
The commit detail Refs row gates on the reactive prop detail.decoration.length, not the non-reactive decorationEl.childNodes.length.
The expanded commit-meta region uses flex: 0 1 auto, min-height min(220px, 60%), max-height 70% and overflow auto, so it is bounded and scrollable rather than unbounded.
commit-meta-clamp.spec.ts asserts that after expansion clientHeight grows past the collapsed cap and overflowY is auto, not scrollHeight <= clientHeight, because the harness fixture is deliberately tall.
PR links in BranchPicker.vue, StackList.vue stack badges and refBadges.ts (SlickGrid formatter badge) are buttons calling pr.browserUrl / GitHubService.OpenPullRequestURL, never raw <a href>, so PRs open in the external browser.
The pr.browserUrl change bumped the git RPC contract version from 35 to 36.
Desktop already opened one tab per changed file for 'open commit changes' (hostHandlers.ts:265-291); the defect was pinned: true making every tab permanent.
previewIdByWorkspace was widened to previewIdsByWorkspace (a cohort); every changed-file tab but the first opens with pinned: false and previewCohort set.
Go to file reuses mapLineAcrossDiff verbatim for the live-file drift line remap; repo-file tabs carry an optional rev and are titled with the short rev when set.
Go to file is wired from FileTree.vue's row menu (gated on sha being available) and RepoDiffView.vue's repo.goToFileFromDiff command.
RepoDiffView.vue has no toast/announce channel, so its go-to-file unavailable/failure case falls back to console.warn, a known gap.
tabs.spec.ts is exclusively the Postgres/DB tab system and repo-workspace.spec.ts's gitStreamMock has no graph.stream or commit.detail support, so the tests went into repo-tab-slots.spec.ts plus new repo-file-tab-revision.spec.ts and repo-go-to-file-handler.spec.ts.
rebuildAncestry has an optional budget parameter (default unchanged) so budget-cutoff tests can use a 5-row fixture instead of 50,000 rows.
wireConformance.test.ts does not exist in the repo.
A contract version bump requires regenerating packages/git-ipc/testdata/graphChunkFrame.{bin,json} (via gitsock TestFixtures_CaptureGraphChunkFrame with KIRA_GIT_FIXTURES=write), renaming TestContractVersion_IsNN in internal/gitrpc/stash_test.go, and classifying new methods in internal/bridge/gitstream.go's allowlist.
internal/bridge/gitstream.go's allowlist must classify every gitrpc method; TestGitrpcDispatch_EveryMethodIsClassified catches a missing one, a security-relevant gap.
internal/grpcclient's reflection test is a known flake under full parallel go test runs; it passes standalone.

### v1.8 P75 Review tab: fix navigation, then UX polish
The collapsed-row "Open all changes" failure in the review tab happened because row-action bundles were built per expansion (inside expand()), so a never-expanded ReviewCommitRow had no bundle and read undefined.
The row-action bundle lives at session scope (ReviewSessionState.rowActions), set in setTarget, cleared in clearTarget and reused by expand(), so it is available before a row is expanded.
"Open in graph" was broken because the anchor was a command:kiraVersion.openCommitInGraph URI, a VS Code webview mechanism with no handler in Kira Studio's Wails WebView.
Contract request graph.revealCommit ({repoId, sha} -> {revealed}) is answered locally by both hosts: desktop in hostHandlers.ts (reusing the blame-reveal stash/activate sequence), VS Code in proxyHandlers.ts via graphProvider.runUiAction('revealCommit', …).
Contract version was bumped from 36 to 37 for graph.revealCommit; stash_test.go's TestContractVersion_Is36 was renamed to Is37 and graphChunkFrame.{bin,json} were regenerated with KIRA_GIT_FIXTURES=write.
graph.revealCommit is host-answered (same class as review.open), so it needs no new internal/bridge/gitstream.go allowlist entry.
Run the fixture regeneration and TestGitrpcDispatch_EveryMethodIsClassified in the same commit as a contract change, because stale artifacts otherwise need a follow-up commit.
The comment compose zone was unclickable because in pinned monaco-editor@0.56.0 .view-zones is appended before .view-lines, which is position:absolute with z-index:auto, so it wins hit tests over the earlier sibling.
Both view zones this repo creates (comment compose zone and the error-banner zone's Retry button) use z-index: 10, VS Code's own value for view-zone widgets.
The compose zone's fixed 120px height is only a starting guess, corrected once via a nextTick-deferred scrollHeight measurement of the mounted .review-thread root plus layoutZone, so long comments scroll in their own box instead of clipping.
user-select: text is set on .review-thread because Monaco's .view-lines layer otherwise wins text selection inside the zone.
The FileTree.vue mark-reviewed control is a real input type=checkbox reusing the package's square-checkbox CSS in app-shell.css (P67c D8), replacing the KuiButton icon toggle.
The indeterminate (partial review) checkbox state has its own codicon-dash glyph (\eacc) and fill, sharing every other declaration with :checked, rather than a third color on a two-state control.
The mark-reviewed checkbox sits at the leading edge of the file-tree row, with a same-width empty slot on directory rows, so the tree keeps one aligned checkbox column instead of shifting with the +N/-N counts' width.
The mark-reviewed checkbox uses click.prevent because ReviewFilesState.mark's server answer is its only state; an optimistic native toggle would contradict it during the round trip.
A fully reviewed file no longer gets the whole-line reviewed tint: paint() in both reviewDecorations.ts (desktop) and reviewMarking.ts (VS Code) skips it when coverage({start:1,end:lineCount}, reviewedRanges) === 'full'. Per-hunk glyphs, the partial-review overview ruler and the file tree's checked box are unchanged.
fakeReviewHost.ts scripts review.files (three none/partial/full entries), editor.openAllChanges and graph.revealCommit responses, each recorded onto its own window.__*Calls array like editor.openDiff.
transport.ts's emitUiAction and localEmittersByCodeRepoId are left in place though no longer called, kept as a general-purpose primitive for pushing ui.action from outside a host handler closure; deleting them would cascade into localEmittersByCodeRepoId's other read site.

### v1.8 P76 Git-blame status-bar widget and right-click worktree creation
RepoFileView.vue's blameable check is gitRepoId !== undefined && rev === null, because blame.line always blames the working tree and revision-pinned repo-file tabs (read via file.read) would otherwise show worktree blame against different bytes.
blameLine.ts owns the blame.line request/debounce/cache/cancellation lifecycle; blameAnnotation.ts keeps only the Monaco decoration/hover/reveal-action rendering, driven by a BlameLineController.
In the blame controller, the same-line early return must precede cancelPending, and an aborted request must never be cached as a miss.
BlameLineController exposes gitRepoId and transport so the reveal action can call graph.revealCommit without a second transport lease.
state/blameStatus.ts is an owner-token store mirroring cacheStats.ts/appMetrics.ts, so workbench/ never imports views/repo/ or repo/git/ directly.
RepoFileView.vue creates the blame controller whenever blameable, regardless of the inlineBlame setting; inlineBlame only attaches/detaches blameAnnotation.ts's renderer, so the status-bar item still works with it off.
StatusBar.vue renders the blame item on the left (data-testid blame-status) with author, relative date and subject, and an absolute-date tooltip; clicking it calls graph.revealCommit, with no new contract method.
The createWorktreeHere row action is a plainItem, not gatedItem, because worktreeAdd is not in GATED_OP_KINDS, so it stays enabled during an in-progress operation.
createWorktreeHere is offered in buildRefMenu's branch/remoteBranch arms and buildRowMenu's commit-row menu, never for tags (the tag's commit row already offers the detached item) and never in read-only builders.
WorktreeCreateSeed (state/worktrees.ts) replaces WorktreeDialog.vue's boolean createOpen with createRequest, and a seeded reset watch applies mode/branch/startPoint defaults on open.
Create-worktree seeds: commit row uses mode detach with startPoint sha; local branch uses existingBranch with branch; remote branch uses newBranch with branch+startPoint via localNameForRemoteBranch. BranchPicker.vue handles ref rows identically, forwarded through AppToolbar.vue/WorktreeList.vue's widened create-worktree emit.
The P76 work touched no Go file and needed no contract change or CONTRACT_VERSION bump.
gitStreamMock.ts takes an optional additive third parameter merged into resultByMethod; it is opt-in per call, so existing callers still hang on every method beyond app.init/repo.list/refs.list.
mockRuntime.ts's inferredBootMode() maps a tabsList boot tab kind through TAB_KIND_MODE, where repo-file/repo-graph map to the sentinel 'repo' (not a real AppMode), so seeding a repo-file active boot tab without an explicit windowsEnsure snapshot crashes WorkbenchShell.vue on first render.
In repo-workspace.spec.ts, seed a repo-file boot tab together with an explicit windowsEnsure snapshot (mode 'studio') to avoid the inferredBootMode sentinel crash.
In the revision-pinned blame test, repo.open and blame.line are deliberately left resolvable so the item's absence proves the rev === null guard rather than passing vacuously.
The revision-pinned repo-file tab in the test is seeded with rev set directly via IPC.tabsList, because real navigation paths need graph.stream/file.goToTarget, which are out of the mock's scope.
blame-line-controller.spec.ts covers: same-line in-flight, later line superseding earlier, aborted request never cached, RPC failure cached as a miss, repo.changed scoped to its own repo, and the all-zero sha resolving to 'uncommitted'.

### v1.8 P77 Redesign the branches/stashes dropdown
BranchPicker.vue folds its seven stacked sections into five KuiSegmented tabs (Branches, Tags, Stashes, Worktrees, Stacks) sharing one filter box and one scrollable body.
pickerModel.ts is a pure fold out of the template, following the convention of refListModel.ts, stashListModel.ts and stackListModel.ts.
refListModel.ts is untouched by the P77 redesign because review/BaseSelector.vue and review/ReviewView.vue still call it directly.
The single filter box matches each tab's own row identity, including stash, worktree and stack rows, and every tab's badge shows a live match count computed for all five tabs on every keystroke regardless of the active tab.
Local branches rank HEAD first, then a branch checked out in another worktree, then the rest by committerDate descending; remote branches and the global stash bucket rank by recency alone.
Tags keep naturalCompare ordering, the stash stack keeps its own index order, and Stacks keeps its forest order; none of these three are reordered by recency.
A pinned row is never capped out (capWithPins), and a per-list "Show more" step (capSteps, threaded from BranchPicker.vue) raises only that list's cap.
Opening the branch picker panel focuses the filter box; ArrowDown from it moves into the first row, and ArrowUp/ArrowDown/Home/End/Enter roam the active tab's rows using enabledNeighbour/firstEnabled from @kira/kira-ui.
enabledNeighbour and firstEnabled take MenuItem[] rather than the {id, disabled}[] that rowIds produces, so BranchPicker.vue pads rows with a local toMenuItems() before calling them.
BranchPicker.vue uses a local lastEnabled() for the End key because kira-ui has no such function and enabledNeighbour(items, undefined, -1) does not walk backward correctly from no selection.
The five row-owning children (TagList, StashList, GlobalStashList, WorktreeList, StackList) have a focusedRowId prop only for :tabindex/:data-row-id binding; roving-focus logic lives in BranchPicker.vue via one native keydown listener on the shared scroll container.
Selecting a stash now sets hasSelection (it also checks selectionIsStash), a stashState.selected watch opens the detail pane at a narrow breakpoint, and StashList/GlobalStashList emit selected, closing the picker via the existing closeForCheckout().
Four new UiActionKind members (openTagPicker, openStashPicker, openWorktreePicker, openStackPicker) each open the branch picker on its own tab, replacing eight MUTATING_COMMANDS entries that previously funneled into plain openBranchPicker.
AppToolbar.vue's openBranchPicker expose forwards an optional tab to BranchPicker.open, and App.vue's runUiAction gained four cases for the new picker actions.
The contract version was bumped from 37 to 38 in both validate.ts and Go's contract.go, kept in lockstep; stash_test.go's TestContractVersion_Is38 asserts the Go constant directly, and graphChunkFrame.{bin,json} were regenerated.
toggle() opens the panel through open() so focus-on-open runs on a plain trigger click; the click path passes no tab and keeps the last active tab.
pickerModel.ts wraps a Stacks-tab entry as PickerList<PickerStackGroup> ({summary, branches}) so a stack's base and needsRestack survive alongside its branches into StackList.vue.
fakeGraphHost.ts has a withPickerData option adding opt-in scripted responses for refs.list, stash.list, globalStash.list, worktree.list and stack.list; existing callers keep hanging on every other method.
pickerModel.test.ts has 15 unit cases, and branch-picker.spec.ts covers tab badges, tab switching, match counts following tab switches, focus-on-open and filter/first-row roving-focus boundaries; rowMenuModel, stashListModel and stackListModel tests are untouched.

### v1.8 P78 Code navigation: Cmd/Ctrl+click fix, Go inheritance matching, reference/implementation wiring
Cmd/Ctrl+click cross-file underline/preview did not render because standalone Monaco's StandaloneTextModelService.createModelReference only resolves an already-open model, and goToDefinitionAtPosition's single-result branch only calls addDecoration inside that promise's .then.
Ctrl+click on macOS is not a bug: Monaco's clickLinkGesture picks metaKey under isMacintosh, never both.
apps/kira-studio/frontend/src/views/repo/textModels.ts is installed once in loadMonaco()'s .then before the first editor.create; it resolves tab-owned URIs via mod.editor.getModel and kira-repo URIs with no open tab by reading the file via codeWorkspaceReadFile and routing through getOrCreateModel.
Preview models in textModels.ts are kept in a capped LRU registry that evicts least-recently-resolved models; a preview promoted to a real tab leaves the registry and is not evicted.
Go method receiver types, interface method names and embedded field/interface names are captured by queries/go/p78_method_sets.scm as ordinary reference/symbol rows, with no schema migration.
internal/codegraph/methodsets.go methodSet walks embedding up to a depth cap of 8 with a cycle guard so mutual embedding terminates.
Go implementation matching is seeded by rarestGoMethodName (the wanted method with the fewest FindSymbolsByName rows) and matches by method name only, never by signature.
Go implementation results always have Scoped confidence, never Exact; rule strings are implementationsOf.goMethodSet for own methods and implementationsOf.goMethodSet.promoted for ones completed via embedding.
The resolver has a seventh tiebreak, sameReceiver, which demotes (does not filter) same-receiver-type Go method candidates ahead of basenameMatches, computed only when the reference site is inside a Go method.
codegraph.Site has a Confidence field: Exact for an IncludeDefinition row, the group's own confidence otherwise, RepoWide for a singleton.
codeworkspace nav.go References never early-returns on an empty Sites list, because Total/Truncated/Unattributed can carry a real reading (all occurrences unattributed) even then.
navigation.ts registers reference and implementation providers on the same scheme-scoped selector as the definition/hover providers, and is the sole writer of the state/navStatus.ts store, which StatusBar.vue renders as the nav-status item.
The nav status shows the 'method set, signatures not compared' caveat only when every target's rule starts with implementationsOf.goMethodSet.
Hover markdown shows a 'Receiver-matched (Go)' line, replacing the blanket 'not type-resolved' disclaimer, only when every target resolved via sameReceiver.
RepoFileView.vue and RepoDiffView.vue set gotoLocation.multipleReferences and multipleImplementations to 'peek' while definitions stay 'goto', because the hover already lists every candidate.
Playwright modifier-click tests must press Meta, never Control, because this tier's WebKit reports a Macintosh UA and a Control press would pass vacuously.
Known gap: rarestGoMethodName's seeding can miss an implementer that owns the seeded method only through embedding/promotion; this is the accepted bounded-cost, no-signature-aware, no-type-inference boundary, not filed as an open item in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md.

### v1.8 P79 Code review
P79 code review was a single round, by SPEC.md's explicit instruction, rather than CLAUDE.md's standard two rounds.
Close every review round with a full-suite verification pass; it is mandatory and not part of any fix batch's own scope.
AdvancedSettings.GitLogLevel and AppearanceSettings.DateFormat existed in the settings schema but were never wired to the storage patch structs, repo read/write or downstream, so they were silently no-op; they are now wired end to end.
internal/logging has SetLevel, called by a SettingsService.Set hook; the level was previously hardcoded to slog.LevelInfo, and "off" silences logging via LevelError + 4.
SettingDef.instanceWide was deleted as a dead flag left over from a removed sentinel-row mechanism.
PrBrowserURL (gitsession/gh.go) and the bridge/github.go validator hardcoded github.com, which broke GitHub Enterprise and made the authenticated-host allowlist not a real allowlist for GHES hosts; both now use repo.Host via the shared IsGitHubHost.
VS Code's proxyHandlers.ts now validates PR URL shape via prUrl.ts, which it previously lacked.
linkify.ts renders commit-body URLs as a button calling the generic link.openExternal wire method, which validates scheme/host before opening, instead of a live anchor href that bypassed external-open capability gates; CONTRACT_VERSION went 38 to 39.
goInterfacesSatisfiedBy's reverse-direction search unions candidates over every method name in have, because seeding from the single rarest method name is only sound in the forward direction.
Never write a truncated depth-cap/cycle-guard result to the memo, because it poisons later unrelated lookups; a truncated bool return gates the memo write.
codeworkspace/nav.go's Definitions, Implementations and References share resolveQueryPoint/resolvePosition helpers, which hold the security-relevant symlink-containment guard.
Anonymous-nested-struct-embed over-promotion in methodsets.go is left as a documented limitation.
Always-on blame RPCs regardless of inlineBlame are a deliberate prior design choice and were not changed.
pr.ts rebuildAncestry excludes ancestors of each PR's baseRef, resolved via the new CommitStore.rowOfBranchTip (local decoration scan, no new RPC); previously it had no base cutoff and tagged nearly all loaded history.
CommitGrid.vue coalesces PR ancestry rebuilds through a shared ancestryRebuildPending flag drained once via nextTick, which also fixes newly-loaded rows never getting PR badges.
Preview-cohort eviction in state/tabs.ts batches evicted tabs into one state mutation and one save, and incognito-off now triggers a save.
The pickerModel Stacks tab count uses the same units as capItems (entries/groups) instead of counting branches.
navigation.ts provideReferences/provideImplementation capture the active tab id before await and check it is unchanged afterward, to avoid publishing a stale nav-status after a fast tab switch.
buildPickerModel's expensive filter is split into filterPickerInput (query-gated) and orderAndCapTab (cheap, per-tab), so tab switches no longer refilter when the query is unchanged.
CommitMeta.vue's PR icon is gated on capabilities.openExternal, like every other external-open surface.
The scheduleResize zero-size guard raced the detailOpen-watcher rebuild, handling the same host resize twice and letting invalidateAllRows() detach a DOM node mid-measurement; fixed with a lastRebuiltHostWidth dedup and keying the KeepAlive skip off the graphVisible signal instead of a 0×0 read.
When rebasing a branch containing merge commits, use git rebase --rebase-merges, because a plain git rebase flattens merges and replays batch commits linearly, causing spurious conflicts with already-integrated content.
Several UI tests are flaky under full-suite parallel load but pass standalone: cell-editor.spec.ts, grpc-request.spec.ts, slick-grid.spec.ts spike test, and commit-meta-clamp.spec.ts; they were filed as P81.

### v1.8 P80 Update main docs
Use git rebase --rebase-merges, because a plain rebase flattens merge commits and reproduces spurious conflicts (recorded in docs/DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md).
P76 shipped the blame status-bar readout as a sibling item, not a LAW-14 violation.
The v1.8 docs update documents only externally visible P79 changes: two settings leaves, GHES host support, link.openExternal, the PR-ancestry base cutoff, preview-model LRU refcounting, and the KeepAlive-visibility pause with its resize-race fix. Internal correctness fixes are left out.
Per CLAUDE.md's repo-map process, the next phase waits for a dedicated fix pass to close an open dogfooding entry. docs/v1.8/mcp-repo-map-issues.md has two open non-trivial entries with no fix-pass phase in v1.8, so they stay open rather than folded into the docs-only P80.
Biome does not check .md files; it reports them as ignored, so markdown docs need a manual read for consistency.
The pre-commit hook runs bun run typecheck across all 5 sub-projects.
docs/ARCHITECTURE.md covers incognito tabs and the external-open capability (link.openExternal, IsGitHubHost/GHES support).

### v1.8 P81 Fix flaky UI tests
In cell-editor.spec.ts scenario 11, the hardcoded elapsed < 250ms timing assertion was replaced with a structural check: a marker attribute on the Monaco root proves instance reuse across a cell switch.
In cell-editor.spec.ts the editor-text read is scoped to the encoded pane, not the panel-wide helper, because row 3's base64 fixture opens a second MonacoHost (decoded pane) that makes the panel-wide locator strict-mode-ambiguous.
grpc-request.spec.ts drives the 150ms schema-load debounce with page.clock.runFor() via the support/clock.ts helper, installed after app boot.
page.clock.install() alone does not freeze time, and pauseAt(Date.now()) fails because CDP round-trip staleness races into the past; the support/clock.ts helper uses a Date.now() + 10_000 forward buffer instead.
slick-grid.spec.ts sub-row/cross-row mutation counts wait for DOM-mutation quiescence (N consecutive quiet animation frames, mutationsForScroll() in support/grid.ts) instead of a fixed waitForTimeout(300); the fixed wait reproduced the flake (2/3 failed), quiescence held 3/3.
The commit-meta-clamp.spec.ts flake was caused by concurrent startCommitMetaHarnessServer() calls under fullyParallel: true racing on a shared on-disk dist/, where one worker's emptyOutDir wiped files another worker's page was loading.
The commit-meta harness server now builds with write: false and serves from an in-memory Map, eliminating the shared dist/ resource rather than partitioning or serializing it.
The repo's Vite 8.3.0 is rolldown-based and has no RollupOutput export, so the build result is typed as Rolldown.RolldownOutput.
http-curl.spec.ts (400ms curl-preview debounce) and mode-switch.spec.ts (150ms mode-write debounce) use the same fake-clock treatment as the gRPC test.
Never fix flaky UI tests by loosening assertions or lengthening timeouts; tighten them to a real condition (structural check, fake clock, quiescence polling, or fixture isolation), because P81's plan explicitly forbids loosening.
Known pre-existing unrelated failures in bun run test:ui include api-ui-consistency.spec.ts:484, interaction.spec.ts:1144, slick-grid.spec.ts:1529, and budgets.spec.ts's wall-clock perf tripwire.

### v1.8 P82 Git module repo-list row polish: drop the hover close button, expand to switch worktrees
The hover close button (x, .repo-row-close, onRowClose) on GitPanel.vue repo rows was removed, because a repository is imported once and rarely removed or closed this way.
The repo row right-click menu (onRepoContextMenu) lists "Close" (when open) and "Remove" (danger-styled), so closing or removing a repo is still possible without the hover button.
Each repo row in GitPanel.vue has a disclosure control (twisty) that expands it to list that repository's own worktrees inline, and each worktree can be switched to directly from the list.
Worktree switching from repo rows reuses WorktreeList.vue's existing switch/open machinery, which BranchPicker.vue also uses, rather than adding a second worktree-switching path.
The new repo/state/worktrees.ts is a per-repo expansion store. It fetches via the gitTransportFor/ensureRepoOpen/worktree.list shape that blameLine.ts already uses, and refreshes live on repo.changed.
Lease invariant in worktrees.ts: a lease exists exactly while a row is expanded. On release, the lease's transport subscriptions are disposed, and the shared git transport is also disposed (via disposeGitTransport, as closeRepoWorkspace does) only when no workspace has the repo open.
Disposing the shared transport closes the real socket and clears the repoOpenMemo entry, so a later re-expand performs a fresh repo.open.
state/coderepos.ts gained canonicalPath, recordForRoot and openRepoAtPath: clicking a worktree opens the existing repo row or imports the worktree first, with an E_ALREADY_IMPORTED race fallback.
A Playwright test shows that expanding a repo row doesn't open the workspace (the @click.stop guard). Clicking a linked worktree row imports, opens and activates it with its own pinned graph tab.
The Close menu item collapses the row's worktree lease synchronously (§8.3).
GitPanel.vue applies a height cap on .repo-section.has-workspace and uses token-based CSS for the expanded worktree list.
P82 changed no Go file, no packages/ file, no contract and no dependency. It is independent of P77's dropdown redesign and of P81.
The app is a Wails v3 native app (GTK4/WebKitGTK on Linux, not Electron/CDP) with no remote-debugging hook, and repo import goes through a native folder-picker dialog, so GUI passes cannot be driven by a driver.

### v1.8 P83 Git module: an embedded terminal, opened at the current worktree
internal/terminal is a domain package that must not import internal/bridge; layering_test.go enforces this by automatic scan.
internal/terminal uses creack/pty with a Session/Registry design: one reader goroutine per session.
Terminal sessions start with Setsid: true so a process started inside the terminal (e.g. npm run dev) dies with the tab instead of outliving it.
Closing a terminal Session sends SIGHUP to the whole process group, waits a 2s grace period, then sends SIGKILL.
loginShell() resolves $SHELL, falling back to the seventh field of /etc/passwd, then /bin/sh; sessions spawn the shell with -l -i at the caller's cwd, never $HOME.
internal/bridge/terminal.go is the single place that turns internal/terminal's plain errors and callbacks into ipcerr responses and push-channel events.
The terminal tab kind has reuse: false, is never persisted, allows many per worktree, and is rendered by RepoTerminalView.vue using a lazy-loaded @xterm/xterm and @xterm/addon-fit renderer (terminalRenderer.ts).
state/terminals.ts owns the client-side terminal session registry.
TabStrip.vue has a "+" button opening a dropdown of tab-creation options, currently only "Terminal", designed to leave room for more entries.
GitPanel.vue repo-row and worktree-row context menus have "Open terminal" items rooted at that row's own path; they are deliberately not routed through packages/git-ui/rowMenuModel.ts because this is a host-only surface.
A terminalCountAtPath registry drives the .repo-terminal-indicator on any repo or worktree row with a live terminal open at its path.
A batched Go call (gitclient.ResolveHead/RepoHeads) plus repo/state/repoHeads.ts drives a .repo-head branch label on every repo row, collapsed or expanded.
worktreeEntries() in repo/state/worktrees.ts always sorts the main worktree first, at the rendering layer only; wt.isMain stays positional (IsMain: i==0 in internal/gitsession/worktree.go) and is not redefined.
A tab kind's dropResources must be a safe no-op for an id it doesn't own, because otherwise unrelated tab kinds trigger side effects; closeTerminalSession in state/terminals.ts returns early if the tabId is not in byTabId (it previously called TerminalService.Close for every tab kind and broke unrelated specs).
Playwright terminal tests in repo-workspace.spec.ts are wiring tests using a synthesized kira:terminal:data chunk; real shell I/O is covered by internal/terminal/session_test.go, not the UI tier.
apps/kira-studio's Taskfile defines only darwin:* tasks (sign, notarize, darwin:package:dmg) and no Linux build/dev task.

### v1.8 P84 Git panel: fix the duplicate worktree listing, split Repositories and Files into separate tabs
Before P84, opening a worktree via switchToWorktree → openRepoAtPath (state/coderepos.ts) imported it as its own top-level code_repos record, so it rendered twice: nested under its parent repo and as a flat top-level row.
Each worktree keeps its own workspace (file tree, search, review, graph); P82 §5.3 rejected switching the graph in place.
An opened worktree appears only nested under its parent repo (marked open/active there), never in the top-level list, which is reserved for explicitly imported repositories.
GitPanel.vue is one PanelShell with a two-option SegmentedControl ("Repositories" / "Files") in the #title slot; the repo-name title was removed. Repositories shows the repo/worktree list; Files shows the active workspace's Files/Search/Review body, each at full panel height.
The 50% height cap and bottom border of .repo-section.has-workspace were deleted because nothing stacks below the list once Files has its own tab.
gitclient.WorktreeIdentity was extracted from Identify's two rev-parse calls (--absolute-git-dir, --git-common-dir), and Identify now uses it.
CodeWorkspaceService.RepoWorktreeLinks returns one parentId per code_repos row, grouped by git common dir. The anchor is the row that is not a linked worktree, else the smallest (sortOrder, createdAt, id). It is shaped like RepoHeads (errgroup, errors never fail the batch).
repo/state/repoLinks.ts is a session-scoped Map store of worktree parent links. switchToWorktree writes a click-time hint so a newly imported worktree never flashes at the top level; GitPanel.vue filters the top level with !worktreeParentId(r.id).
A repo row's isOpen is true when that row, or a row parented to it, is open. Both context menus offer Rename/Close/Remove on the nested worktree row.
The Files/Search/Review control and icon buttons live in the Files tab as a .view-strip. local.repoSearch and local.fileSearch are split so a filter typed on one tab does not hide rows on the other.
A local tab ref, driven by an immediate watcher on repoId, switches to Files whenever a workspace opens or activates and back to Repositories when the last workspace closes.
onRowClick (P67b) opens or activates a repo on a single click, so Playwright specs use .click() rather than .dblclick() on repo rows; the second click of a dblclick lands on the Files tab's view-strip after the auto-switch.
Opening a terminal from a worktree row's context menu calls openRepoTerminalTab → openRepoWorkspace(repo.id), which triggers the auto-switch to Files, so tests must click git-panel-tab-repos before reading repo row state.
The flash window and the RepoWorktreeLinks error path have no dedicated Playwright coverage, because installGitStreamMock cannot hold a stream open.
GitPanel.vue is desktop-only; packages/git-* and apps/kira-studio-vscode are unaffected by P84.

### v1.8 P85 Tab-strip "+" button: launch Claude Code or a configured custom script in a terminal
The tab-strip + dropdown offers Terminal, Claude Code, one entry per user-configured custom script, and a Manage scripts… entry; all launches open the same P83 terminal tab kind over the same PTY/worktree-cwd machinery.
Custom scripts are entirely user-configured; the list starts empty and none are predefined.
When terminal.OpenParams.Command is non-empty, the PTY runs it as $SHELL -l -i -c <command>, with the command as a single argv element and no quoting layer; an empty command gives P83's plain login shell.
maxTerminalCommandBytes (64 KiB) bounds the terminal command length well under macOS's ARG_MAX, so an oversized command gives a clear E_INVALID instead of an opaque E2BIG.
The initial command's own exit status reaches onExit, not a wrapper shell's; TestSessionRunsInitialCommand guards this because P86 needs it.
terminalTabStateSchema gains command, label and color fields, each defaulted so older persisted records still parse through duplicateState -> parseState.
A terminal tab's title is its label, falling back to the cwd's basename, and its rail colour comes from state.color.
The Claude Code dropdown entry launches the fixed command claude; it is not configurable and not probed for availability. A user wanting flags writes a custom script instead.
Every dropdown entry launches through the TabStrip.vue helper launchInActiveWorkspace(launch?, cwdOverride?), and openRepoTerminalTab takes an optional TerminalLaunch (command/label/color).
Custom scripts are stored in the custom_scripts table (migration 0024), a named, ordered, immediately-mutated list shaped like code_repos, not a settings leaf.
CustomScriptFields.Validate() is the sole validation authority: name and command are required and trimmed, workingDir is empty or absolute, and colour must be a valid palette value. The shared zod schema is only the dialog's affordance.
Every CustomScriptsService mutation broadcasts the full list on ChannelCustomScriptsChanged using Emit (not EmitTo), so a second window's dropdown stays live.
The Settings sections list and Section type live in state/settings.ts, with openSettingsAt(section) so TabStrip.vue can deep-link into Settings without importing the dialog component (workbench/ -> state/ is the permitted direction).
The Scripts settings section sits between Git and Code intelligence and bypasses draft/Save: row fields commit on blur (empty reverts), the colour swatch commits immediately, remove asks to confirm, and the add row stages locally until Add is clicked.
Configured scripts appear in the dropdown behind a separator, showing name, command as hint, and a colour swatch or a play icon when colourless; Manage scripts… opens Settings at 'Scripts'.
A custom script launches at its own workingDir, not the active repo's root.
Script dropdown rows have test id menu-item-script-<script.id>, so a fixture id 'script-1' renders as menu-item-script-script-1.
onAddScript in SettingsDialog.vue trims the new script's name and command before building CustomScriptFields, matching onScriptFieldBlur for existing scripts.
P85 touched no packages/git-* or apps/kira-studio-vscode files.
TestBroker_QueueBoundedAgainstUnlimitedEnqueue in pairing_test.go deliberately never resolves the maxQueueLen goroutines it parks in Broker.Request, so they leak for the rest of the test binary's run; the test proves the queue stays capped, not that requests complete.
Under high system load, leaked goroutines from TestBroker_QueueBoundedAgainstUnlimitedEnqueue plausibly push the internal/gitsock package's total test runtime past Go's default 10-minute test-binary deadline.
The project's CLAUDE.md sets the bar for re-running measurements as a real, concrete question genuinely at stake, not routine reproduction.
apps/kira-studio is a Wails v3 native app with no remote-debugging hook, and its Taskfile defines no Linux build/dev task, so it cannot be launched under Xvfb for a manual GUI pass.
Plan §15.3 records two deliberate Playwright coverage gaps: no real shell running a real command, and no cross-window broadcast coverage.

### v1.8 P86 Claude Code lifecycle hooks, opt-in and user-configured, plus a running-agent-sessions status-bar widget
P86 wires Claude Code lifecycle hooks (SessionStart/SessionEnd/PreToolUse/PostToolUse/Notification/Stop) into Claude Code terminal tabs launched by P85; it is opt-in: a user must enable it from Settings.
Hook configuration is never written into a project's .claude/settings.json; --settings always points at Kira Studio's own generated temp path, and no project file is written anywhere in the phase.
claude --settings is additive: project .claude/settings.json hooks still fire alongside hooks from a --settings-supplied file (verified with two independent SessionStart hooks both firing).
A StatusBar.vue widget shows an icon plus the number of running Claude Code sessions (P85's launched terminals), counted across every open workspace, and is absent rather than showing zero when nothing runs.
P86 depends on P85's Claude Code launch entry; the widget is P87's click target, so P87 follows P86.
TerminalOpenArgs.LaunchKind ('shell' | 'claude-code' | 'script') is validated and threaded through the tab state as an explicit discriminator, never by checking command === 'claude'.
The internal/agenthooks package uses a per-enable 0700 temp dir holding a generated hooks.json, a 0700 shim script and a 0600 unix socket served by stdlib net/http.
The hook listener decodes only nine hook-payload fields, truncates a Notification message to 200 bytes on a rune boundary, and never retains tool_input, tool_response or transcript_path.
AgentHooksService starts/stops the listener behind the claudeCode.hooksEnabled setting, read fresh at every launch; TerminalService.Open adds the --settings flag and env only for a claude-code launch when the listener is running.
Keep launchFor unexported, because an exported method would be bound to the wire by Wails and leak KIRA_AGENT_HOOK_TOKEN to the webview.
Settings has a Claude Code section with an instant-effect toggle and error/path display, placed between Scripts and Code intelligence.
terminal.Registry is the single place the app-wide agent session count exists, because a per-window map would disagree between windows and P87's keep-awake control needs one shared truth.
ChannelAgentSessions broadcasts the live session list with Emit (not EmitTo) on every Registry.OnChange, and TerminalService.AgentSessions() hydrates a late-opened window.
The status-bar count is based on PTY liveness, never counts a script as an agent (OQ-5), and is deliberately decoupled from the hook stream.
Hook events are broadcast via ChannelAgentEvent using Emit because a hook event has no window to address; the receiving window filters by terminalId.
reduceAgentActivity is a pure (prev, event) => next reducer that pairs PreToolUse/PostToolUse by tool_use_id rather than a depth counter, since each hook runs in its own curl process and PostToolUse can arrive before PreToolUse; SessionEnd drops the activity entry.
The status-bar tooltip shows each session's basename(cwd) plus activity text (waiting for you / running <tool> / working / idle), and TabStrip shows an attention dot on a non-active Claude Code tab in the 'attention' phase, cleared by activating it.
A dismissible banner above RepoTerminalView's xterm host shows only on a Claude Code tab with hooks off and the prompt not dismissed; Enable calls setAgentHooksEnabled, never types into the PTY, and applies to the next Claude Code tab; Not now persists hooksPromptDismissed permanently.
OQ-2 (curl shim vs. re-invoking the app binary) and OQ-6's exact truncation length remain open, reversible with a measurement.

### v1.8 P87 Titlebar keep-awake toggle, plus an agent-aware auto-awake setting (off by default)
The titlebar action row in TitleBar.vue is ordered left-to-right: Connections, Operations, Settings, keep-awake, New window (New window moved from leftmost to rightmost).
The titlebar keep-awake button has exactly two states, on and off, toggled by a single click, with no dropdown, popover or three-way menu; it uses a coffee-cup icon with .is-on and aria-pressed for the states.
A separate Settings toggle, claudeCode.keepAwakeWithAgents (default false), keeps the machine awake whenever at least one Claude Code session is running, regardless of the titlebar button state.
Keep-awake is asserted whenever the titlebar button is on, OR the agent-aware setting is on and at least one agent session is running; the two sources compose additively.
On macOS keep-awake spawns/kills the child process caffeinate -i -s -w <pid> rather than calling IOPMAssertionCreateWithName/IOPMAssertionRelease via cgo, because Wails has no power-management API, caffeinate wraps the same IOKit API, and direct cgo glue would be unmaintainable and untestable in the sandbox.
Keep-awake is macOS-only; every other OS uses a documented no-op driver.
A separate "keep display awake" sub-toggle (caffeinate -d) was deliberately not included because it goes beyond what was asked.
internal/keepawake's Controller holds a set of named reasons (ReasonManual/ReasonAgent), not a refcount; it acquires only on empty→non-empty and releases only on non-empty→empty, so re-asserting an already-held level is a no-op.
NewPlatformDriver() switches on runtime.GOOS without build tags (mirroring internal/gitclient.NewPlatformLocator): noopDriver everywhere except darwin, where caffeinateDriver is used.
Keep-awake self-heals without a timer: when the reaper goroutine's loss callback flips internal state to false, the next Set/Rearm call (any reason) recomputes and re-acquires.
Resume from sleep is detected via shell.AttachSystemWake, modeled on AttachReopen, registering events.Mac.ApplicationDidWake, so the assertion is re-armed because a live caffeinate process doesn't reliably survive sleep/wake.
The agent-aware setting is stored through all three layers: packages/shared/domain/settings.ts, internal/storage/model/settings.go and internal/storage/repos/settings.go.
bridge/keepawake.go's KeepAwakeService composes the manual titlebar state and the agent-aware setting (gated on AgentSessions()'s running count) onto one Controller, and broadcasts every change on ChannelKeepAwake via Emit, never persisted across relaunch.
Frontend state/keepAwake.ts hydrates and subscribes, mirroring the agentHooks.ts/agentSessions.ts pattern; the agent-aware checkbox in SettingsDialog.vue sits beside the hooks toggle in the Claude Code section.
Controller has a Supported() bool forwarding to the driver, so bridge/keepawake.go can report supported: false on non-darwin.
recomputeAgent() in the keep-awake bridge always re-reads Deps.Repos.Settings.GetAll() fresh.
Verifying the keep-awake assertion with pmset -g assertions is a manual macOS-only step and is not faked in tests.
internal/keepawake tests use a fakeDriver that fails on double-acquire or premature release, a -race concurrent test, an argv golden test (caffeinateArgv), and a process-lifecycle test that polls for ESRCH because the sandbox's minimal init reaps slowly.
The root-level layering test TestDomainPackagesDoNotImportBridge covers the internal/keepawake package, so it must not import the bridge.
The internal/keepawake package cross-compiles for darwin/arm64 with CGO_ENABLED=0 (both go build and go vet).

### v1.8 P88 App-wide checkbox glyph alignment
The off-center checkbox checkmark is not a CSS mistake: the @vscode/codicons check and dash glyph artwork is itself off-center within its 16x16 icon tile. check's ink center is at y=7.495 (about 3% high) and dash's at y=8.495 (about 3% low); true center is 8.
Both checkbox implementations (Checkbox.vue's .p-check .glyph and git-ui's input[type=checkbox]::after) center the glyph tile with flexbox, which reproduces the tile's internal bias instead of correcting it.
The glyph fix is an em-based translateY nudge: +0.03125em for codicon-check and -0.03125em for codicon-dash (0.5/16), so it scales with font-size at both packages' glyph sizes (10px/11px).
The fix is applied in two places, apps/kira-studio/frontend/src/theme/primitives.css (.p-check .glyph.codicon-check/.codicon-dash) and packages/git-ui/src/theme/app-shell.css (checkbox :checked::after/:indeterminate::after), because the checkbox styling is not shared code.
git-ui re-implements checkbox styling itself because it cannot reach the host app's CSS (VS Code webview parity, P67c).
In real WebKit at 14px, the check glyph's vertical offset was -0.31px (kira-ui) and -0.34px (git-ui) before the fix, and 0.0px on both axes after for both glyphs and implementations; Chromium showed the same direction.
A fresh worktree lacks the gitignored Wails-generated apps/kira-studio/frontend/bindings/, so typecheck of changes touching apps/kira-studio/frontend needs them generated via wails3 task common:generate:bindings (pinned wails3 v3.0.0-beta.21 from go.mod).
DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md's scoped-typecheck workaround for missing bindings covers only git-only changes, not changes touching apps/kira-studio/frontend.

### v1.8 P89 Studio: FK preview action layout, SQL format-button regression
In the FK preview popover (FkPreviewPopover.vue), the layout is header/actions/body flex, and only the body (.fk-preview-body) scrolls, so "Open in new tab" stays visible under the header regardless of previewed row width.
The FK preview popover has no "Edit this record" action; the cell context menu's "Edit referenced row" item (fkEditItem in menu.ts) is the sole entry point for editing a referenced row.
ConsoleView.vue's localDoc is a shallowRef, and Vue skips the dep trigger when the assigned value equals the current one, so after format-undo-format the second identical result was a silent no-op and Monaco kept showing the unformatted text.
MonacoHost's props.doc watcher body is factored into applyExternalDoc/setDoc (with the doc === model.getValue() guard); ConsoleView's tab.state.text watcher calls it directly and updates lastEmitted there. ConsoleSavedMenu.vue's setText goes through the same watcher.
The "(ClickHouse identifiers)" aside is omitted from the format note on non-ClickHouse consoles.
The Format button's keywordCase 'preserve' (P13 D4) only touches whitespace by design, and the "Already formatted" note fires when result.text equals originalText byte-for-byte.
A regression test in console-format.spec.ts (format→undo→format) fails against the pre-fix source and passes after the fix.
tests/ui/interaction.spec.ts's P67 case 3 drives the cell-menu "Edit referenced row" item instead of the removed popover edit button.

### v1.8 P90 Api module: configurable request settings, a Cookies tab, and a broken multi-line value editor
The Api module has seven request settings, each configurable globally in Settings and per request (overriding the global default): httpVersion (1 or 2, default 2), requestTimeoutMs (default 0/none), maxResponseMb (default 50), sslVerify (default on), followRedirects (default on), maxRedirects (default 10), disableCookieJar (default on).
Go's httpclient.Send takes an Options struct (all pointer fields, nil means default) instead of reading package constants.
resolveSendOptions/orGlobal in bridge/http.go resolve a request's seven null-means-inherit tab-state leaves against the global settings row before every send.
Setting sslVerify to false shows a plain-prose security warning taken verbatim from the plan, per a CLAUDE.md carve-out for that class of text.
Cookies use one process-wide cookiejar.Jar keyed by publicsuffix, and incognito sends use a throwaway per-send jar.
Response has SentCookies and ReceivedCookies fields, populated from the trace's WroteHeaderField hook and every hop's own Set-Cookie.
Both request and response Cookies panes reuse one CookiesPane.vue component. Request mode shows what the jar would send next, debounced on URL change and after every send. Response mode shows sent/received cookies grouped by hop.
Secrets in the new SentCookies and ReceivedCookies response fields are masked by maskSecrets, through two new loops, like every other response field.
Grow-field multi-line bug, first cause: the UA padding of 2px on the textarea was absent from the sizing replica. Fixed as the plan described.
Grow-field second defect: a grid item's normal alignment resolves to start, not stretch, for a replaced box with an intrinsic size in that axis (a textarea counts via its rows attribute). The textarea stayed at 1-row height and scrolled from row 2. Fixed with an explicit align-self: stretch.
The overlay never painted on a grow textarea because the selector .input-wrap input.has-overlay did not match a textarea. It was widened to input.has-overlay, textarea.has-overlay, and line-height: inherit was added so overlay lines do not drift from the textarea's lines past line 2.
The Playwright grow-field test reads line boundaries from the overlay's own Range client rects, not a hard-coded character count.
The container has no display (docs/DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md), so the Playwright ui project is the repo's established substitute for GUI-driven checks.

### v1.8 P91 New module: Terminal — quick-command scripts panel and tabbed terminal sessions
The Terminal module is a fourth top-level module (AppMode 'terminal'), placed last in MODE_ORDER, with async TerminalPanel.vue and TerminalStart.vue; Go validWindowModes includes it.
tabs.ts hydrateTabs skips non-repo workspaces via !isRepoWorkspace(key) instead of an enumerated studio/api skip-list, so a bare 'terminal' workspace survives session restore.
Go DefaultCwd returns the user home directory (os.UserHomeDir), or an empty string on failure so it never fails boot; it is hydrated once at boot into terminalDefaults.cwd and used by the Terminal module's unscoped launches.
openTerminalTab was factored out of openRepoTerminalTab (state/terminalTabs.ts) so a terminal tab can open under the bare 'terminal' workspace without the openRepoWorkspace side effect, which would otherwise silently jump into Git; openRepoTerminalTab delegates to it.
TabStrip.vue uses one wrapper element whose testid switches on tab count, so the Terminal module's empty initial state (no pinned graph tab) still shows the "+".
The Terminal module's "+" menu (terminalModuleMenuItems) deliberately omits Claude Code and per-script entries, since the left panel already covers scripts; it lists Terminal plus one entry per known repository/worktree, each opening a scoped terminal within the Terminal workspace.
Every quick-command and scoped launch from the Terminal module carries workspaceId 'terminal' and never redirects into a matching repo's Git workspace.
TerminalPanel.vue is a second view over P85's existing custom_scripts store, not a separate module-scoped list; quick commands therefore also appear in a repo workspace's "+" menu. It offers search, inline add, run-on-click, and a Run/Edit…/Remove context menu.
The panel's "Edit…" deep-links to the Settings dialog's Scripts section rather than re-implementing four fields in a 180-480px panel.
The terminal-panel testid must sit on an outer wrapper, not in PanelShell's #body slot, because that slot renders only when non-empty and the testid would not mount with zero custom scripts.
The Terminal module reuses P83's PTY/terminal-tab machinery (creack/pty backend, xterm.js frontend) and is deliberately simple: no split panes, no saved session state beyond the existing terminal tab kind, no per-script argument prompts; a quick command runs its exact configured command.
The Terminal module's quick-command list starts empty with no predefined entries, and clicking a script runs it in a new terminal tab.
The http-request-body.spec.ts assertion "every IPC call stays under 500 bytes" fails deterministically, likely because P90's per-request Api-settings payload (7 new override leaves sent with every httpSend) made the threshold stale; not a P91 regression.

### v1.8 P92 Git panel: graph column/scroll/labels, titlebar new-window button, diff tabs, review nav, go-to-file, tab-persistence...
The pinned repo-graph tab's creation path left path unset, tripping the DB's NOT NULL constraint on the first write; it now gets a real (empty-string) path.
When a git graph row's height changes after first render (e.g. a late decoration chunk), every row below must be repositioned via invalidate(), not updateRowCount() + render(), which never repositions already-cached rows.
The git graph column has a drag handle and a capped default width (DEFAULT_GRAPH_LANE_CAP, 6 lanes/95px) instead of growing unbounded with branch count; PersistedViewState is at v7.
Ref/tag badges in the git graph render as an outline (colored border, transparent fill) instead of a filled chip.
General settings include a control for git-graph font size.
The title bar has a "New window" button before the project-panel toggle, which calls WindowsService.OpenNew.
Repos, Files and Review are three peer top-level tabs in GitPanel, not Review nested inside Files' own Files/Search strip.
The diff view has a visible go-to-file action that reuses P74's existing open-and-land-on-line path.
"Open all changes" on a commit opens one repo-multi-diff tab with per-file collapsible sections, and only the expanded section's editor mounts, instead of one tab per changed file.
SlickGrid's _columnDefaults carries a hidden minWidth: 30 merged onto any column declaring none, clamping narrower seeded widths up. graphColumnWidth(0) = 17 at mount was inflated by 13px, causing the graph's horizontal scrollbar sizing bug.
Graph columns in columns.ts declare minWidth: 0 (not undefined) on all four columns, because updateColumnProps() clamps only when m.minWidth is truthy, so only a falsy value disables it.
The loadedRows watcher calls scheduleResize(), deduped via lastRebuiltWidth, as a defensive fix for platforms whose scrollbar consumes layout width.
graphStreamFixture.ts builds a real graph.stream chunk with the actual @kira/git-ipc FlatBuffers codec, and gitStreamMock.ts reassembles the blob-frame wire format in-page, because gitStreamMock.ts previously only answered unary req/res and not streamed binary chunks.

### v1.8 P93 Git graph: collapse non-checked-out branches by default, branch-ordered commit layout
By default the git graph renders fully expanded, commit by commit, only the checked-out branch's own direct-ancestor chain.
Every non-checked-out branch in the git graph collapses to two visible points, where it starts (diverges from what's shown) and where it ends (its own tip); intermediate commits hide behind a single clickable expandable row. Clicking it expands that branch's own intermediate commits inline.
The git graph layout engine (layoutStore.ts/geometry.ts) currently assumes one row per commit unconditionally, so collapsing must be reconciled with lane assignment and graph-line layout.
The git graph currently interleaves commits from different branches by timestamp (standard git log --graph order).
The git graph is to switch to branch-ordered layout: all commits of one branch's own chain render consecutively before the next branch's commits, so the user never sees commits alternating between branches. The checked-out branch's own commits render first at the top, followed by each other branch's own commit group.
Likely default ordering for non-checked-out branch groups is most-recently-active branch first; the planning pass must state it with a reason.
Graph incremental/streamed history loading (graph.stream, chunked) and lane-column rendering currently assume rows arrive in commit-timestamp order; branch-ordered layout interaction must be confirmed in planning.
The collapse and branch-ordering changes (phase v1.8 P93) touch packages/git-ui/src/graph/ (layoutStore.ts, layout.worker.ts, rowSvg.ts, geometry.ts, graphColumn.ts) and CommitGrid.vue's row model.
The collapse and branch-ordering changes land together as one phase because both concern how a non-checked-out branch's commits are grouped and shown.
Phase v1.8 P93 needs its own dedicated planning pass before implementation. Planning must design the collapsed row visuals, expand state scope (per-branch, per-session vs persisted per repo), and collapsing of sub-branches.

### v1.8 P94 Repo-wide code-quality tooling: complexity, dead-code and performance linters, pre-push hook, CI wiring, fix every fi...
Frontend/TS/Vue cognitive-complexity check is Biome's complexity/noExcessiveCognitiveComplexity, built into @biomejs/biome 2.5.13; Go complexity uses golangci-lint's gocognit and gocyclo.
knip is used instead of ts-prune for unused exports/files/dependencies in TS/Vue packages, because ts-prune is unmaintained and its README points at knip; for Go, golangci-lint's unused linter covers dead code.
scripts/install-golangci-lint.sh builds golangci-lint from source against the repo's own Go toolchain with GOTOOLCHAIN pinned, because a prebuilt release binary is built with an older Go than go.mod's go 1.27.1 and refuses to run.
.golangci.yml enables 11 linters: bodyclose, copyloopvar, gocritic (performance tag only), govet, ineffassign, makezero, prealloc, unconvert, unused, plus gocognit and gocyclo at min-complexity 30 with _test.go excluded.
golangci-lint errcheck (220 findings) and staticcheck (49 findings) were declined in P94 by name and opened as P95 rather than silently dropped.
golangci-lint is configured with uniq-by-line: false, because the v2 default (true) hid 28 of gocyclo's 32 findings behind a gocognit finding on the same func line.
Biome performance rules enabled: noAccumulatingSpread, noDelete, noBarrelFile, noReExportAll.
mockStreamBrowser.js's matchKey() sets key = undefined instead of using delete in a loop, since JSON.stringify drops undefined values identically.
knip.json has one workspace block per package/app, and @types/vscode, @vscode/codicons, @vscode/vsce and tailwindcss are in ignoreDependencies because each is resolved through a non-static-import mechanism.
knip treats packages/git-core/src/search/differentialRunner.ts as an entry because it is invoked as a bun run subprocess from apps/kira-studio/internal/gitsearch/differential_test.go.
knip treats scripts/demo-dbs/sqlite/seed.ts as an entry because it is a manual, README-documented script with no package.json wrapper.
git-core's src/index.ts re-exports every port and setting directly from source, so the ports/index.ts and settings/index.ts barrels were redundant and deleted.
knip.json sets rules.duplicates to "warn" rather than the default "error", because most duplicate-export findings are deliberate documented same-value exports across unrelated subsystems; the reason is recorded inline in knip.json.
lint:dead is plain knip with no --include filter, so it also gates exports, types and binaries.
.githooks/pre-push runs go build ./..., bun run lint:go and bun run lint:dead, guarded on node_modules existing; package.json gained scripts lint:go, lint:dead and lint:all.
.github/workflows/pr.yml cannot be pushed from the sandbox, so the CI change is a patch at docs/pending-changes/.github__workflows__pr.yml.patch, per docs/DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md's workaround.
Pass 1's gocritic/unused/prealloc/copyloopvar fixes did not change complexity scores, because they do not add or remove branches.
Shared relational read/mutate helpers were hoisted into internal/adapters so the three SQL adapters consume one copy.
(*Router).ForConn Request dispatch in gitrpc uses a package-level requestHandlers map[string]requestHandler lookup table, because every arm already forwarded to an existing handler, so a table clears the gocyclo score with less code moved.
TestGitrpcDispatch_EveryMethodIsClassified's AST walk recognises both switch method statements and map[string]XxxHandler{...} composite literals, so it does not undercount the dispatched-method set.
A table-driven test for StripSQLComments was added in pass 2, as it had no direct test before.
GOOS=darwin cannot be cross-compiled from the sandbox container: internal/gitclient's unconditional cgo FSEvents file and internal/codeparse's tree-sitter cgo binding fail, and Wails does not cross-compile for main.
main has no test files; its boot proof is test:ui's real backend built with -tags server, the established substitute for a GUI boot check in a display-less sandbox.
http-request-body.spec.ts has a known pre-existing flaky form-data payload threshold assertion (expect(size).toBeLessThan(500), received 657) that reproduces in isolation and is owned by pass 4.
test:ui can fail tests such as tree.spec.ts (120s timeout) under 4-worker parallel runs due to resource contention; they pass alone, so they are flakes, not regressions.
To tell resource contention from regression in test:ui, re-run the failing test alone with --project=ui --workers=1.
Biome complexity/noExcessiveCognitiveComplexity is enabled at maxAllowedComplexity 30; an overrides entry for test globs (**/tests/**, **/test/**, **/*.test.ts, **/*.spec.ts) exempts test-only functions.
The Biome complexity rule fires only on exceeding 30, so a function scoring exactly 30 (rowPlan.ts's projectLayoutInput, a split phase of buildRowPlan) passes; beautify.ts:43's parseJsonString stays under the gate at 29.
The knip baseline after the complexity refactors is 73 exports plus 50 types, 123 findings; the delta from the earlier 122 is InlineBlameAttachParams, a type introduced by the useInlineBlame.ts extraction.
knip.json sets ignoreBinaries: ["go"] because go is the system toolchain invoked by six package.json scripts, not an npm bin, and dropping --include turned on knip's binaries rule.
Knip triage found no test-only-helper exemption and no intentional-public-API category; the fixes were 105 keyword-drops, 15 re-export-list prunes and 3 deletions.
Three unused exports were deleted outright: findVariableSetTab in api/tabs.ts, gutterWidth in graph/rowSvg.ts, and tabsForMode in state/mode.ts. The last two had zero callers anywhere, as Biome's noUnusedVariables flagged once export was removed.
Removing the re-export from curl/parse.ts left tokenize.ts's CURL_WARNING_KINDS unused, so it was fixed in commit 24 with its doc comment pointing at index.ts's real re-export path.
knip's ignoreExportsUsedInFile is declined because it would clear the 105 keyword-drops with one config line but blind future passes to genuine dead public surface.
The 4 remaining knip configuration hints, which ask for .vue/.css compiler registration, stay declined: .vue imports already resolve without it, and honoring them would require converting knip.json to knip.ts for no functional gain.
A table-driven test for lintMongoBrackets was added (commit 7), raising unit tests from 1538 to 1543.

### v1.8 P95 Go error-handling and correctness linters: `errcheck` and `staticcheck`
P94 pass 1 enabled nine golangci-lint linters and declined errcheck (220 findings) and staticcheck (49 findings) by name, because they are error-handling/broad-correctness work outside the complexity/dead-code/performance categories P94 scoped itself to; reason documented in docs/v1.8/plans/P94-code-quality-tooling.md §4.1.
Each of the 269 errcheck/staticcheck findings needs a per-call judgement, not a mechanical rewrite: for errcheck, handle the error, log it, or explicitly discard with _ =; for staticcheck, whatever its per-finding rule calls for.
Phase P95 plans by grouping the findings by package/pattern, enables both errcheck and staticcheck in .golangci.yml, and states the fix judgement for each group before implementing.
A deferred fix becomes its own named phase, not a line in a result section (CLAUDE.md); P94 named errcheck and staticcheck in its declined-linter table instead of silently dropping them.
<!-- /chapter v1.8 -->

<!-- chapter v1.9 -->
## v1.9
Source: docs/v1.9/ at bd0c224688d9. 57 phases.
The v1.9 chapter continues the running P numbering from P96 (v1.8 covered P71-P95) rather than taking a fresh letter.
v1.9 drops the repo-map subsystem.
v1.9 adopts a frontend library baseline of Pinia, TanStack Query, VueUse, shadcn-vue and Tailwind, and migrates onto it.
The git module and native code workspace are extracted into a standalone app, Kira Space (P100).

### v1.9 P96 Finish P94's pass 4: full-suite flake sweep
The http-request-body.spec.ts 500-byte bound failure was deterministic, not a flake: openTab's unconditional saveNow() fires when new-request-start opens the tab, and that first tabsSave serializes to 657 bytes, over the stale bound.
The http-request-body.spec.ts fixture is 4 MiB and every logged call is bounded against PICKED_FILE.file.size instead of a magic number, so schema growth (httpRequestTabStateShape outgrew the 500 constant) cannot erode the bound again.
The internal/grpcclient deferred reflection failure is not a port race: v1 negotiation always answers a well-formed Unimplemented in under 1ms, but in the v1alpha fallback (the second RPC) grpc-go's HTTP/2 transport occasionally ends the stream with a bare io.EOF (codes.Unknown) under scheduling pressure.
retryOnTransportGlitch wraps both v1's and v1alpha's reflection round trip and retries a bare transport glitch up to 4 times with a 50ms delay; the delay is load-bearing because an immediate no-delay retry did not lower the failure rate.
A client-side WaitForReady-only fix only roughly halved the grpcclient reflection failure rate (13/8109 vs 26/8226), so the retry approach was chosen instead.
The grpcclient test assertion is correct: a real schema error must still surface as CodeSchema, confirmed by mutation check.
startStubReflectionServer originally had no readiness wait at all, a real gap fixed in fc1d32f regardless of the root-cause finding.
The Biome useImportType finding in RequestSettingsPane.vue is a template-blind false positive: the imported constants are used as values only inside <template>, which Biome does not analyse, so applying its fix would erase the import at runtime and break the v-for/:min/:max bindings.
biome.json's **/*.vue override turns off noUnusedImports, noUnusedVariables and useImportType, because Biome cannot see template usage; this replaced 12 per-line biome-ignore comments across 7 files.
The UncommittedChangesStrip.vue:49 Biome finding was a genuine useShorthandFunctionType hit and was fixed in code (ace58f0), not suppressed.
markdown-reading.spec.ts's pre-toggle scroll snapshot used expect.poll(...).not.toBe('0px'), which checks non-zero rather than settled; it now uses an in-page stability loop of six consecutive quiet frames, the same idiom as mutationsForScroll in support/grid.ts.
http-request-body.spec.ts's XML token-colour check called hasTokenColor() one-shot right after a language switch and text insert, racing Monaco's asynchronous tokenization; it is now wrapped in expect.poll.
Playwright skips ui-timing's 4 tests when a ui test fails because ui-timing depends on ui; they pass in an isolated --no-deps run, so this is a reporting artifact, not a coverage gap.
The chapter continues P numbering (P96+) rather than taking a fresh letter; P96 carries over v1.8's last open item (P94 pass 4, a full-suite flake sweep with no new lint rules).

### v1.9 P97 Drop repo-map/tree-sitter code intelligence; Biome lints Vue files
P97 removed the repo-map MCP server and its tree-sitter code-intelligence engine: internal/repomap, internal/codegraph, internal/codeparse, cmd/kira-repo-map, the frontend nav surface, the Settings Code intelligence tab, RepoMapService, code_repos.mcp_enabled, the codeIntel.mcpServerEnabled setting and migration 0025.
In-app code navigation (go-to-definition, hover, F12) was explicitly dropped by instruction and not replaced.
internal/mcpinstall and internal/mcpauth remain because both are internal/dbmcp's dependencies (bearer-token install flow, auth middleware), never repo-map's.
EnumerateAll moved from internal/codeindex to internal/codeworkspace/enumerate.go because ListFiles and Search still call it for repo-wide file listing.
internal/codeworkspace/textpos.go (LineIndex/utf16Units) was kept because search.go depends on it for column computation and it has a correctness test.
Biome lints .vue files via html.experimentalFullSupportEnabled on, with html.formatter.enabled off to avoid whitespace churn across 126 files from an experimental formatter.
The biome.json **/*.vue override turns off three rules: a11y, useVueHyphenatedAttributes and noNonNullAssertion. The reasons are recorded in commit d64808b's message, because biome.json cannot hold comments.
useVueHyphenatedAttributes is off because Vue does not re-camelize aria-*/data-* attributes to a component's declared prop (e.g. KuiSegmented.ariaLabel), so the rule's fix stops matching the prop and vue-tsc reports a missing required prop.
noNonNullAssertion is off for Vue templates because templates do not narrow types across separate calls of a v-if-guarded expression, so the rule's ?. suggestion yields '| undefined' against a required type and vue-tsc rejects it.
255 lint/a11y findings across 85 files are deferred to row P105, added after P99, because they concentrate in the dialogs, menus and pickers that P99 replaces.
This Biome version's Vue support does not link scope across the plain script block and script setup block of one SFC, so functions declared in one and used in the other are falsely reported as unused. RepoTerminalView.vue's loadTerminalRenderer and TreeHost.vue need a targeted biome-ignore.
In StashList.vue and StashDialog.vue, the stash@{N} label stays string concatenation with a biome-ignore, because a template literal puts two closing braces before the mustache's }} and this Biome Vue parser reads that as its delimiter, causing a parse error.
P97 added four biome-ignores (TreeHost.vue, RepoTerminalView.vue, StashList.vue, StashDialog.vue); SlickGridHost.vue and ConsoleSlickGrid.vue have pre-existing unrelated noExplicitAny ignores.
frontend/bindings/** is entirely gitignored (apps/kira-studio/.gitignore), so regenerating bindings produces no commit.
The 'repository-wide search has no include/exclude filter' Known-open-item stays in the docs because it is still true after P97. CLAUDE.md's standing rule keeps that section only while genuinely open.
After P97, bun run test:ui has 311 tests in total.

### v1.9 P98 Add shadcn-vue, Tailwind CSS, VueUse, Pinia, TanStack Query as standing deps; codify Vue conventions in `CLAUDE.md`
Every future phase's planning pass must adapt its design to lean on shadcn-vue, Tailwind CSS, VueUse, Pinia and TanStack Query rather than hand-rolling equivalents; e.g. new UI styling goes through Tailwind rather than custom CSS even if the spec didn't say so.
Every Vue component must use script setup lang="ts" (Composition API only, no Options API); this is codified in CLAUDE.md.
Pinia stores follow single-responsibility: one store, one concern, never a grab-bag app-wide store.
P98 is prep only: it adds the libraries and minimal bootstrap plumbing, migrating no existing .vue file, store or styling; P99 does the migration onto the already-wired libraries.
state/pinia.ts exports the single createPinia() instance, and main.ts registers Pinia and the TanStack Query plugin before directive/mount.
state/queryClient.ts exports one QueryClient with retry: false and refetchOnWindowFocus: false, because every query resolves over the Wails bridge to the local Go process, never the network.
The @ alias maps to ./src in both vite.config.ts resolve.alias and tsconfig.json compilerOptions.paths; existing source keeps relative imports, and @/ is for shadcn-vue's generated import specifiers.
shadcn-vue is configured with reka-ui base, nova style, neutral base color, lucide icons and CSS variables; files are components.json, src/lib/utils.ts and src/theme/shadcn-bridge.css.
shadcn-bridge.css maps every shadcn-vue variable to an existing --kira-* token, and base.css imports it after ./vscode-bridge.css.
There is no .dark block in the shadcn bridge because tokens.css is a single :root and index.html hardcodes class="dark".
The icon dependency resolved by shadcn-vue's lucide registry is @lucide/vue 1.47.0, not lucide-vue-next.
src/lib/utils.ts uses a single combined clsx import in the repo's style, with an explicit : string return type on cn().
knip.json has ignoreDependencies entries for @vueuse/core, reka-ui, class-variance-authority, tw-animate-css, @lucide/vue, clsx and tailwind-merge, plus a workspace ignore for src/lib/utils.ts.
Pinia 4.0.3, @tanstack/vue-query 5.103.2 and @vueuse/core 15.0.0 were added to root package.json; VueUse needs no bootstrap.
docs/ARCHITECTURE.md Stack table records the frontend library baseline (Vue/Vite/Tailwind v4/shadcn-vue on Reka/Pinia/TanStack Query/VueUse); P99 will migrate the app's 39 reactive() modules and 200 .vue files onto them.
shadcn-vue CLI 2.8.2 does not support --dry-run, --diff or --view.
Never unset HTTPS_PROXY to work around shadcn-vue 2.8.2 init failing with TypeError: fetch failed (it passes undici's ProxyAgent into ofetch calling the runtime's global fetch); see docs/DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md.

### v1.9 P99 Part 1 shadcn-vue component set; every store on Pinia; every ad hoc fetch on TanStack Query
The P99 plan is docs/v1.9/plans/P99-vue-migration.md; scope is the 143 .vue files under apps/kira-studio/frontend/src plus the 45 reactive state modules beside them, not packages/git-ui (46 files) or packages/kira-ui (11).
packages/git-ui and packages/kira-ui are excluded from P99 because they have no Tailwind build, are git-ui's own primitive layer (0 .vue usages from the studio app), and P100 extracts them wholesale.
P99 follows one touch per file: every .vue file is opened for judgment in exactly one part; work runs as one sequential subagent per part, in order, with no parallel fan-out.
Part 1 runs first so Parts 2-4 open every file with its state layer already final.
shadcn-vue add cannot run in the sandbox (root-caused in P98), so shadcn-vue components are fetched via a verified direct-registry curl procedure.
17 shadcn-vue primitives live under frontend/src/components/ui/: alert, button, checkbox, command, context-menu, dialog, dropdown-menu, input, input-group, label, popover, scroll-area, separator, textarea, toggle, toggle-group, tooltip. No app code imports them yet; Part 2 is the first consumer.
knip.json's 7 bootstrap ignoreDependencies entries (from P98) must stay until Part 2 imports the first shadcn-vue primitive; removing them now makes lint:dead flag all 7 as unused.
All module-level reactive()/ref() state modules are now Pinia setup stores: 71 defineStore() calls across 65 files, more than the plan's estimate of 45 modules to 41 stores.
state/connections.ts, state/tabs.ts, api/state/curl.ts, api/state/variables.ts and project/state/tree.ts were each split into two Pinia stores for a real two-concern reason (e.g. connection records vs. the connect dialog's UI state).
views/grpcrequest/state.ts's two createRuntimeStore runtimes (gRPC call and schema-browser) were merged into one useGrpcRequestViewStore because they share one registerTabRuntimeCleanup teardown and are torn down as a coupled unit.
state/schemas.ts was split so DDL fetch/save moved to TanStack Query while the dialog's draft state stayed a Pinia store, rather than the two-Pinia-store split guessed in plan §1.3.
The only remaining reactive()/ref() call sites are the generic factory definitions (createRuntimeStore in views/shared/viewOp.ts, createHistoryStore in api/state/history.ts) and composable factories (createPageSearch, createPageStore, useEditBuffer, useDiffEditor), which produce fresh state per call and are out of scope.
Plain Map/Set registries (state/tabRuntime.ts, state/viewCommands.ts, state/repoOpenHold.ts, maskRules.ts's correlationKeys) were left alone because they were never reactive() and are out of scope.
Exactly 10 modules subscribe to backend broadcasts via control.on*Changed(): state/connections.ts, customScripts.ts, dbmcp.ts, gitClients.ts, keepAwake.ts, layout.ts, schemas.ts, settings.ts, tabs.ts and project/state/tree.ts; the plan's count of 13 was inaccurate.
The broadcast subscriptions are registered inside the store body on first use and write the same reactive field, except schemas.ts's onSchemaChanged, which calls queryClient.invalidateQueries instead.
state/schemas.ts's ensureDdl/saveDdl, state/maskRules.ts and views/grid/PreviewCommandPanel.vue were migrated onto TanStack Query (PreviewCommandPanel uses useQuery in place of the ref([])/loading/error triple).
maskRules.ts's upsertMaskRule/removeMaskRule re-call loadMaskRules synchronously instead of using useMutation with invalidateQueries, because invalidateQueries only refetches an active useQuery observer and some callers (menu.ts existingMaskRule scan, ConnectionDialog.vue Privacy tab) have none; this matches schemas.ts's saveDdl.
Never hoist a Pinia store call such as useConfirmDialogStore() to true module scope without an explicit pinia argument in files reachable from main.ts's static imports, because it runs before app.use(pinia) and throws at boot (no active Pinia).
views/browse/menu.ts, views/documents/menu.ts and api/reveal.ts call useConfirmDialogStore() inline at their single call site instead of hoisting it; repo/git/transport.ts's module-top-level useGitCredentialStore(pinia) correctly passes the explicit pinia singleton.
After regex call-site sweeps, run grep '// .*storeName\.' to catch comments wrongly re-qualified, and check for storeName.storeName double-prefixes, because blanket regexes rewrite function names mentioned in comments.
test:ui timing flakiness (budgets.spec.ts scroll-delta percentile, slick-grid.spec.ts pacing-histogram invariant) is a known ui-timing/pacing-budget class, flaky under cross-file worker contention and documented in the tests' own comments.
test:visual has a pre-existing baseline of 5 failures (connection-dialog, console, data-view, schema-dialog, workbench), unrelated to P99.
After Part 1, baselines are: test:unit 1535 passed, test:webview 55 passed, and knip with 6 duplicate exports plus 4 config hints, all pre-existing.
SearchResults.vue in packages/git-ui has a dual script block that P99 fixes (§2.3), the one deliberate crossing of the scope boundary.

### v1.9 P99 Part 2 shell, chrome and the primitive layer (48 files)
Each theme/primitives/* wrapper keeps its public prop/emit/slot API while its internals move onto shadcn-vue, so Parts 3-4's 95 files need zero edits from Part 2.
DialogFrame.vue builds on reka-ui's DialogRoot/DialogPortal/DialogOverlay/DialogContent directly, not through the registry wrapper in src/components/ui.
AutocompleteField.vue declines reka-ui/shadcn combobox because its Listbox+Popover shape assumes single-select, which doesn't fit the field's free-text-plus-suggestions model.
workbench/ContextMenu.vue stays hand-rolled; DropdownMenuRoot and ContextMenuRoot were declined because reka-ui's item slot lacks props for swatch/checked/danger/shortcut/hint content, its trigger model assumes one owning trigger versus this point-anchored singleton with many call sites, and forking the tuned keyboard model risked a behavior regression.
The tooltip system keeps its directive-plus-singleton architecture (AppTooltip.vue and workbench/state/tooltip.ts), per the plan's own recommendation.
initTooltips() must keep returning an explicit manual-teardown () => void, because leaks.spec.ts and App.vue rely on it rather than implicit unmount cleanup.
SettingsDialog.vue's 375-line scoped style block was converted to @apply utilities under @reference "@/theme/base.css" rather than inlining 50+ template class usages.
The primitives.css .p-btn/.p-dlgbtn/.p-iconbtn cleanup is out of scope for Part 2, because those classes are still used in terminal/, views/, api/ and repo/.
TreeRow.vue must keep the selector name .spin (body @apply animate-spin;), because tests/ui/tree.spec.ts and tests/ui/support/tree.ts select .twisty .spin directly.
TreeRow.vue's local @keyframes pulse was renamed tree-row-pulse, because Vue scoped CSS doesn't scope @keyframes names and Tailwind v4 defines a global pulse at a different timing.
ErrorPopover.vue attaches its document listeners via useEventListener at setup time (not in onMounted), preserving immediate-attach/auto-detach timing.
SchemaDialog.vue must keep its explicit onBeforeUnmount cancel of the useDebounceFn debounce, because VueUse's debounceFilter has no built-in tryOnScopeDispose.
App.vue's onMounted/onUnmounted pairs are control.on*() IPC subscriptions, not DOM listeners or timers, so they are left without VueUse equivalents.
tw-animate-css, @lucide/vue, clsx and tailwind-merge stay in knip ignoreDependencies because their only importers are src/lib/utils.ts and src/components/ui/**, both in the workspace ignore list.

### v1.9 P99 Part 3 the API client surface (39 files)
FieldRowsTable.vue keeps its script setup lang=ts generic=... unchanged, per the plan's named note.
GrpcRequestView.vue replaced its manual setTimeout/clearTimeout schema-load debounce with useDebounceFn plus explicit .cancel() calls, before rescheduling and on unmount.
The classes .request-pane, .request-splitter, .url-field, .grpc-target-field and .grpc-method-field keep their names because api-ui-consistency.spec.ts, http-request.spec.ts and grpc-request.spec.ts select them directly; their CSS is still converted to @apply.
Very small style blocks (one or two rules) in ApiStart.vue, CopyAsCurlDialog.vue, SaveRequestDialog.vue and BinaryBodyPicker.vue are inlined into template classes and the style block dropped, rather than using @apply.
EditRawRequestDialog.vue uses useDebounceFn with an explicit setter and onBeforeUnmount cancel (same as SchemaDialog.vue) because its dialog-open handler must write both live and debounced values immediately, which refDebounced cannot do.
ImportCurlDialog.vue uses refDebounced directly because it has no requirement for an external immediate write.
The classes .twisty and .node-icon in CollectionRow.vue keep their names as test markers in mutations.spec.ts, fake-data.spec.ts and tree.spec.ts.
The grid-template-columns literal in VariableRow.vue and VariableSetView.vue stays plain CSS beside the @apply line, because Tailwind has no named utility for an explicit column template.
Component-local clipboard writes (copyUrl in CollectionsTree.vue, onCopy in VariablesOverviewPanel.vue, onCopyRequest/onCopyResponse in RawExchangePane.vue) keep their copyText() calls rather than useClipboard(), following Part 2's precedent.
CollectionRow.vue's .rename-input border uses border-[var(--kira-accent)] instead of border-accent, because shadcn-bridge.css maps --color-accent to --kira-hover (grey), not --kira-accent (brand blue).
In the compiled CSS, .bg-accent compiles to background-color: var(--accent) (grey), and .text-accent-fg compiles to no rule at all.
AppButton.vue and IconButton.vue use bg-accent/text-accent-fg for the primary variant without a rendering bug, because unscoped, unlayered .p-btn.primary/.p-dlgbtn.primary rules in primitives.css supply the real --kira-accent background, and unlayered author CSS wins over Tailwind v4 layers.
The .response-body and .response-status-row classes in the http response pane keep their names because api-ui-consistency.spec.ts and three http-*.spec.ts files select them directly.
The grpc ResponsePane.vue keeps the .response-status-row class name for consistency with the http component, though no grpc test selects it.
The test:visual suite has 5 failing specs as a pre-existing baseline (connection-dialog, console, data-view, schema-dialog, workbench).
The ui-timing/pacing-budget UI tests are flaky under cross-file worker contention.

### v1.9 P99 Part 4 data, repo, terminal and editor views, plus the phase-closing audit (56 files)
SlickGridHost.vue and ConsoleSlickGrid.vue carry zero style lines, so their migration work is VueUse only.
RepoTerminalView.vue's dual script block was fixed by moving lazy-loaded terminal-renderer state into sibling module terminalRendererLoader.ts, which retired the P97 biome-ignore.
The P97 biome-ignore (lint/correctness/noUnusedVariables) was needed because Biome's Vue support can't link scope across a plain script and a script setup block in one SFC.
BrowseView.vue's keyTypesDebounceTimer setTimeout/clearTimeout pair was replaced with useDebounceFn, with ensureKeyTypesDebounced.cancel() in onBeforeUnmount, following the SchemaDialog.vue precedent.
Hover styles needing the accent color use text-[var(--kira-accent)] instead of the text-accent utility, as a workaround for the accent/--kira-hover cascade-layer problem documented in CollectionRow.vue's rename-input.
SlickGridHost.vue's viewportEl scroll listeners and ResizeObserver stay hand-rolled because their registration order relative to SlickGrid's internal scroll listener is load-bearing for the velocity sampler, and onUnmounted's hand-ordered teardown (§6 D3) can't take a composable's onScopeDispose cleanup.
SlickGridHost.vue's header-cell zone/sortIndicator click listeners stay hand-rolled because SlickGrid creates and destroys those nodes per header-cell render, after setup()'s effect-scope capture, so they are not stable Vue-tracked refs.
SlickGridHost.vue's onPaste keeps navigator.clipboard.readText() instead of useClipboard, because useClipboard's read() is not documented to preserve the promise-rejects-on-permission-denial contract the existing try/catch depends on.
SlickGridHost.vue's scrollSaveTimer became a useDebounceFn (persistScroll) with an explicit .cancel() in onUnmounted.
ConsoleSlickGrid.vue mirrors SlickGridHost.vue's three declined patterns for the same reasons.
FkPreviewPopover.vue's document keydown Escape listener uses useEventListener, mirroring PopoverPanel.vue.
RepoTerminalView.vue's ResizeObserver, constructed in mount() after await loadTerminalRenderer(), stays hand-rolled because Vue's synchronous current-instance tracking is lost across the await, and converting would need a behavior change that §9.4 forbids.
GitPanel.vue's two raw navigator.clipboard.writeText() calls (Copy path on repo and worktree rows) now use the app's shared copyText() wrapper, as TabStrip.vue and OperationsPanel.vue do.
Existing copyText() calls are left unconverted to useClipboard.
GitPanel.vue's .prompt-scrim keeps literal z-30 rather than var(--kira-z-dialog), because the prompt raises directly from the panel, unlike ConsoleSavedMenu.vue's prompt-scrim, which is raised from inside a popover with its own full-viewport backdrop (P28 D17(c)).
MonacoHost.vue converts only host-wrapper rules (.monaco-host, .monaco-host-pending, .monaco-host--single-line.monaco-host-pending) to @apply; rules reaching Monaco's own DOM (:deep(.monaco-editor), :global(.monaco-hover), :global(.suggest-widget)) or Monaco tokenizer classes (:deep(.kira-ed-*)) stay plain CSS.
DateTimePicker.vue keeps its custom calendar; replacing it with the shadcn calendar component was declined, and only CSS/VueUse conversion applied.
Never let behavior changes ride along with a conversion (plan §9.4).
CLAUDE.md's git policy amends commits only on an explicit user request.
The §12.3 phase-closing audit runs whole-tree over apps/kira-studio/frontend/src, so it surfaced pre-existing hand-rolled patterns in files no part had been assigned.
The search-debounce watch+setTimeout pairs in api/state/collections.ts and project/state/tree.ts were converted to refDebounced.
state/mode.ts, state/layout.ts and views/repo/blameLine.ts use useDebounceFn, with .cancel() replacing the old clearTimeout.
state/tabs.ts saveDebounced uses useDebounceFn with .cancel() replacing clearTimeout; saveNow and flushPendingTabState still flush immediately by calling the underlying save function directly.
The repo/git/hostHandlers.ts clipboard.write RPC handler uses the copyText() wrapper, the same one GitPanel.vue uses.
In project/state/tree.ts the trim/lowercase step lives in activeSearchQuery's computed, so searchResult must read activeSearchQuery.value, not debouncedQuery.value. This keeps TreeRow.vue highlighting and row matching identical to pre-conversion behavior.
views/httprequest/cookies.ts keeps its per-tabId debounce map, because useDebounceFn debounces one function identity. A per-key cache of debounced instances would be a new abstraction for one call site, which §9.4 forbids outside a genuine multi-site finding.
views/shared/slick/scrollTrace.ts keeps its raw clipboard write. Its optional-chained navigator.clipboard? guard and outer synchronous try/catch handle a context where the Clipboard API may be absent (a dev-tool console hook), which copyText()/useClipboard() don't account for.
SlickGridHost.vue's insert-region el.addEventListener listeners stay hand-wired. They share the hand-ordered onUnmounted teardown sequence with the viewportEl listeners, and a declined-with-reasoning comment was added.
Remaining raw addEventListener and ResizeObserver uses are intentional. They are non-component .ts modules with no active Vue effect scope (kiraSlickGrid.ts, reviewDecorations.ts, views/grid/slick/editor.ts, repo/git/transport.ts) or named declines (order-dependent teardown listeners in SlickGridHost.vue/ConsoleSlickGrid.vue, header-cell zone listeners, RepoTerminalView.vue's async-boundary construction).
The §12.3 audit found zero reactive()/module-level ref() uses outside a store and zero manual loading/error/isLoading fetch triples.
Every .vue component has exactly one script block, confirmed across all 269 .vue files in apps/kira-studio/frontend/src and packages/git-ui/src. RepoGraphView.vue's second grep hit is a comment mentioning script setup.
Scoped-CSS lines fell from a 7,125-line baseline to 5,260 (26% reduction). Remaining plain CSS covers :deep() reaching third-party DOM, :global(), @keyframes, grid-template, calc() mixing a literal 14px with --kira-s-* tokens, and a deliberately preserved literal z-index: 30 in GitPanel.vue.
Several Part 2/3 files (SettingsDialog.vue, ConnectionDialog.vue, OperationsPanel.vue, TitleBar.vue, TabStrip.vue, FiltersDialog.vue) still use plain-CSS var(--kira-*) declarations where a Tailwind utility exists (e.g. text-muted). They were left alone, since fixing them means re-verifying shipped files outside Part 4's 56-file assignment, which CLAUDE.md's carve-out treats as outside the phase's scope.
Four of P98's seven knip bootstrap ignores remain (tw-animate-css, @lucide/vue, clsx, tailwind-merge), because no app file outside src/components/ui/** or lib/utils.ts imports any of them directly. The other three (@vueuse/core, reka-ui, class-variance-authority) were removed in Part 2.
bun run lint:dead is clean apart from the baseline of 6 pre-existing duplicate exports and 4 config hints.
No theme/primitives wrapper was deleted anywhere in v1.9, so there is no orphaned primitive.
With biome.json's **/*.vue a11y: off override removed, biome check over the frontend src, packages/git-ui/src and packages/kira-ui/src reports 255 errors across 86 files (P97 baseline: 255 across 85). P99 fixes none of it; it is P105's starting point.
The budgets.spec.ts scroll-response p50 assertion is contention-sensitive and tuned against a specific dev machine; it fails under full-suite cross-file worker contention (13ms measured against a 12ms budget) and is a pre-existing environmental flake, not a regression.
The ui-timing Playwright project has dependencies: ['ui'], so its tests are skipped ("did not run") when any ui test fails; run with --no-deps to check them directly.
cell-editor.spec.ts can fail with 'locator.click: Target page, context or browser has been closed' under the full suite; this is a known pre-existing timeout signature (documented in a comment in SlickGridHost.vue) and passes when isolated with --workers=1.
bun run test:visual has a documented baseline of 5 failing specs: connection-dialog, console, data-view, schema-dialog, workbench.
Baselines after P99 Part 4: test:unit 1535 passed, test:webview 55 passed, and knip (lint:dead) reports 6 duplicate exports plus 4 config hints, all pre-existing; build has only a pre-existing chunk-size warning.
P99 migrated every .vue file in apps/kira-studio/frontend/src (plus packages/git-ui's one crossing) to Tailwind, shadcn-vue, VueUse, Pinia and TanStack Query; docs/ARCHITECTURE.md's Stack row was changed from "P99 migrates" to "P99 migrated".
P99's phase-closing audit runs exactly once, at the end of the last part, over the whole tree rather than only that part's files.

### v1.9 P100 Part 1 the Go extraction
apps/kira-space cannot import anything from apps/kira-studio/internal/ because of Go's internal/ visibility rule, so shared packages were hoisted to a repo-root internal/ first.
Eight packages were hoisted to repo-root internal/: ipcerr, notify, pathsafe, rpcstream, startupfail, logging, plus new kirapaths and sqlitex (generalized from Studio's config/storage path-join and migration-runner logic).
startupfail and logging were parameterized when hoisted (startupfail.Info/Reporter dependency injection, logging.Init taking a logs-dir argument) because neither could stay a process-wide singleton once two apps link it.
The extraction moved 15 git packages to apps/kira-space: the 13 originally planned plus internal/ghclient (importers gitrpc, gitsession) and internal/codeworkspace (importers bridge, main.go); 272 Go files, 62,066 lines.
Kira Space has its own home ~/.kira-space (KIRA_SPACE_HOME), its own kira.db, review.db and git.sock; a shared git socket is impossible because gitsock.Server.Start's flock makes the loser silently not listen.
The git packages were moved by copy-forward/delete-backward: each was copied to apps/kira-space leaving Studio's copy intact, and one final commit deleted all old Studio copies, because moving gitwire first would break Studio's still-resident gitsock, which imports it.
The plan's §4.6 suggested move order was not a valid topological order (gitstore imports gitclient/porcelain); the real order was computed with Kahn's algorithm.
apps/kira-space builds without a frontend/; frontend/dist/index.html is a force-added placeholder so //go:embed compiles. Root package.json scripts dev:space/build:space/package:space/typecheck:space-web are deferred to Part 2.
apps/kira-space's 0001_init.sql has no layout/tabs tables, since nothing in Part 1 uses them; model.Settings is trimmed to Appearance/Advanced.GitLogLevel/Git, and repos.Repos to 5 fields (Settings, Windows, GitClients, CodeRepos, GitRepoSettings).
Kira Space's bridge uses a trimmed appcore.Deps (Repos, Events, GitRegistry) and local StreamSession and Browser interfaces with only the methods gitstream.go/github.go call, to avoid importing adapterhost/appupdate.
apps/kira-space/internal/bridge/events.go declares only the channel constants ChannelCodeSearch, ChannelGitPairing and ChannelGitClientsChanged, which are not yet subscribed since there is no Events.Attach wiring in Part 1.
Kira Space's shell is simpler than Studio's: quit has no per-window flush handshake, menus are minimal (3 sections, no ItemEmit kind), and app.go has no Dialogs or AttachSystemWake; wireGit is lifted wholesale from Studio's.
Kira Space's main.go is now the only askpass entry point; Studio's askpass shim was removed from its main.go.
kira-space's gitreview DefaultPath() uses config.KiraSpaceHome() instead of config.KiraHome(), which is undefined in kira-space's config package.
layering_test.go exists in both apps with its own modulePrefix and exemption set; Kira Space's exempts only internal, internal/bridge and internal/shell. TestDomainPackagesDoNotImportBridge checks domain packages do not import bridge.
Studio's model.Settings kept advanced.gitLogLevel and GitSettings because they are mirrored in packages/shared/domain/settings.ts and SettingsDialog.vue; removing them Go-only would break the settings round-trip, and removal needs a frontend change outside the Go-only phase.
In Studio, ValidLogLevel was moved into settings.go (its only remaining caller) and LinkService's fakeBrowser test double moved into link_test.go, after their original files were deleted with the git code.
The git-related wiring was removed from Kira Studio: wireGit/gitWired, git-threaded parameters in wireEmbeddedServices/wireLifecycle/postAppDeps, the 3 git Services entries, and shell/app.go's RegisterGitStream.
The pairing-notification block (wirePairingNotifications and its helpers) was removed because gitsock.OnPairingChanged was its only trigger; the notifications package and its notifier variable were removed too, since Studio has no other caller.
bridge/events.go dropped the Git Sources field and the two pairing channels; a comment points at their new home.
model/window.go's validWindowModes no longer includes "git"; a stored git row degrades to studio through NormalizeMode, as for any unrecognised mode, so no migration is needed for the window-mode leaf.
internal/ipcfixture/harness.go never referenced the git bridge services, so it needed no edit.
Migration 0026_p100_drop_git_tables.sql drops the git_repo_settings, git_clients and code_repos tables.
tabs.workspace_id was kept in migration 0026 because every remaining tab already parses as workspace_id IS NULL, and dropping the column would rewrite the whole table for no behavioural gain.
The one-time import of pairings and repo list (§4.5) was scoped out of Part 1 per the plan's named fallback. It needs a settings read/write path in kira-space's boot, a first-boot ordering step after the DB opens and before any repo/pairing read, and handling of a second database (review.db) without damaging either file.
Part 1 has no SettingsService bridge in kira-space; nothing reads settings beyond Advanced.GitLogLevel at logging.SetLevel time. The deferred import is left for the orchestrating session to schedule as a new phase or in Part 2.
docs/ARCHITECTURE.md Known open items is Part 4's to edit, so the deferred first-boot import is not recorded there.
Kira Space creates ~/.kira-space/git.sock at mode 0600 at startup.
gitsock.Start() fails with 'bind: invalid argument' if the KIRA_SPACE_HOME socket path exceeds Linux's ~108-byte sun_path limit, so a short path is needed.

### v1.9 P100 Part 2 the frontend extraction
P100 Part 2 moves 53 files (8,238 lines) to Kira Space: all of repo/ (21), all of views/repo/ (23), seven state/ stores (now Pinia stores since P99 Part 1), and two workbench/ dialogs.
monacoEntry.ts (app-wide Monaco bootstrap that editor/monaco.ts dynamically imports) and monarch/{mongo,redis,decorators}.ts under views/repo/ are not git-related and stay in Kira Studio, relocated to editor/ as a P60a layering leftover.
apps/kira-space/frontend is a workbench built on Tailwind/shadcn-vue/VueUse/Pinia/TanStack Query per CLAUDE.md, with a ported shell subset, because the moved files import 17 Studio stores and 10 theme/primitives components.
Hoisting a shared packages/workbench and adopting packages/kira-ui as the primitive layer were both weighed and declined (plan §5.2); Kira Space ports its workbench instead.
Kira Studio drops AppMode's 'git', WorkspaceKey collapses to AppMode, and packages/shared/domain/workspace.ts is deleted rather than stubbed.
packages/theme is a single shared package holding tokens.css, base.css, 18 shadcn-vue components/ui components with lib/utils.ts, 12 verbatim-identical primitives ports, stickyBand.ts, connColor.ts, wrapSelection.ts and CodiconIcon.vue; both Kira Studio and Kira Space import it via '@theme/...'.
Kira Studio adopted packages/theme by deleting its own components/ui, theme/primitives and theme css/ts copies outright rather than keeping them alongside; vite.config.ts, tsconfig.json and components.json in both frontends point at the shared package.
ColorPicker and completion.ts were dead before the P103 dedup and are absent from packages/theme; connColor.ts and wrapSelection.ts were added because they were found identical during the pass.
Tailwind v4's automatic content scan roots at the Vite project root and does not reach sibling monorepo packages, so packages/theme/src/base.css needs an explicit @source "./"; directive, placed after every @import per CSS at-rule ordering.
Never use Tailwind v4 bracket-integer arbitrary values like z-[1]/z-[2] in this setup, because they generate no CSS; use the bare-integer form z-1/z-2.
The z-[1] bug caused the tests/ui/tree.spec.ts sticky-band stacking-order assertion failure, fixed in VirtualList.vue, ProjectTree.vue, StreamView.vue and RepoFileTree.vue.
Running sh scripts/setup.sh (wails3 task common:generate:bindings -clean=true) deletes and rebuilds the gitignored frontend/bindings/ from current Go source, so stale binding files that keep bun run build green are removed and hidden breaks surface.
Kira Studio's bridge/index.ts no longer imports gitclientsservice, githubservice and codeworkspaceservice bindings (services moved to Kira Space in Part 1); the dead git/codeWorkspace bridge methods were removed, and the unused @kira/git-ipc dependency was dropped from Kira Studio's package.json.
ColorPicker.vue, completion.ts, repo/QuickOpen.vue, repo/state/quickOpen.ts and the quick-open-index-truncated-reactive unit test were left out of Kira Space because they were dead or have no quick-open surface there.
apps/kira-studio-vscode/src/commands.test.ts fixture paths OPS_GO/REMOTE_GO/STACK_GO were updated because gitsession moved from kira-studio/internal to kira-space in Part 1.
Fix a failing or stale reference when found, not in a later phase, per CLAUDE.md's standing rule.
Root wiring added dev:space/build:space/package:space/typecheck:space-*/test:ui:space scripts, knip.json workspace blocks for apps/kira-space/frontend and packages/theme, check-tokens.sh resolving --kira-*/--kui-* references inside packages/theme/src, and sign-bundle.sh support for the second bundle.
The fuzzysort dependency was dropped from root package.json and go-toast/v2 from go.mod via go mod tidy, since both became unused after P100 Part 1 moved their consumers.
apps/kira-space/frontend/dist/index.html is untracked (git rm --cached), matching Kira Studio which tracks no files under frontend/dist; it was a placeholder so Go's //go:embed all:frontend/dist compiled before a real frontend existed.
Kira Space has no WindowsService, a design simplification documented in main.ts's comment, so a plain ?window=main request returns 400 "unknown window: main"; a real Startup-created window UUID is required.
Kira Studio's WindowsService.Ensure() auto-provisions the main window row, so the plain fallback ?window=main boots with zero console errors.
The real native shell in Kira Space (internal/shell/window.go) always navigates with URL "/?window=" + w.Key against a row Startup already created, so the missing plain-URL window is only an ad hoc diagnostic limitation, not a product defect.
On a fresh KIRA_SPACE_HOME with no repos imported and no git-client config, Kira Space logs first-run console errors (422 resource loads and "codeworkspace: git is unavailable: notFound" rejections); this is a config probe finding nothing, not a missing git binary.
Part 2 added typecheck:space-web, typecheck:space-unit and typecheck:space-tests, so bun run typecheck now covers eight projects.
The new knip.json workspace blocks for apps/kira-space/frontend and packages/theme each add a ".vue extension not registered as compiler" configuration hint, raising knip hints from 4 to 6 (exit 0, not unused-code findings).
The VS Code extension is still named kira-studio-vscode; renaming it is Part 3's job.
Under concurrent heavy load, tests/ui/sql-schema.spec.ts can fail spuriously; this resource-contention pattern is documented in the repo's sandbox notes and is not a real bug.

### v1.9 P100 Part 3 the extension rename, retarget and packaging
The VS Code extension was renamed from apps/kira-studio-vscode to apps/kira-space-vscode, with package name kira-space-vscode and displayName "Kira Space"; identifiers moved to the kiraSpace./kira-space prefix.
The 11 kiraVersion.* settings keys are RepoSettingsSnapshot's key space in packages/git-ipc/src/contract.ts, so renaming them is a contract change (CONTRACT_VERSION 39 → 40 on both sides, plus its pinning test).
All 11 kiraVersion.* wire keys (graph.pageSize, graph.scope, stash.showInGraph, stash.includeUntracked, review.baseCandidates, pull.strategy, log.level, github.enabled, worktree.prepareScript, worktree.basePath, checkout.autoStash) were renamed to kiraSpace.*, in both RepoSettingsSnapshot and *Patch json tags (BREAKING CHANGE).
CONTRACT_VERSION/ContractVersion was bumped from 39 to 40 on both TS and Go sides, and gitrpc/stash_test.go's TestContractVersion_Is39 became TestContractVersion_Is40.
No data migration is needed for the settings-key rename: the git_repo_settings.key column stores short undotted leaf names (e.g. graphPageSize, logLevel, advanced.gitLogLevel), decoupled from the wire namespace by an earlier P72 redesign, so a kiraVersion.% migration would be a no-op.
The kiraVersion.* keys were never VS Code settings.json keys; apps/kira-space-vscode/package.json has no "configuration" section, and they were only wire-protocol JSON field names.
packages/git-ipc/testdata/graphChunkFrame.{bin,json} bake in the contract version and must be regenerated after a version bump, because unwrapVersioned rejects the old version. Regenerate with KIRA_GIT_FIXTURES=write go test ./apps/kira-space/internal/gitsock/... -run TestFixtures_CaptureGraphChunkFrame, then run bunx biome check --write.
Sweep the rename per-file, never with a repo-wide replace, because that would rewrite the DB client's own name in docs/, scripts/demo-dbs/ and NOTICES.md.
"Kira Studio" was replaced with "Kira Space" only where the string named the backend app, never where it named the DB client.
Some references were deliberately left unchanged: DB-client citations in theme CSS/readTokens.ts, the @kira-version/git upstream npm package citation in packages/git-ipc/src/rpc.ts (a real external dependency), and the immutable migration 0017_g18_git_repo_settings.sql.
The manifest has 47 command ids, not the plan's 62; the pre-rename manifest already had 47. All were renamed kiraVersion.<verb> → kiraSpace.<verb> and the command category became "Kira Space".
The manifest has 10 colour ids, not the plan's 14: kiraSpace.graphLane0-7 plus kiraSpace.reviewedLineBackground and kiraSpace.reviewedLineOverviewRuler.
Container and view ids were renamed: panel container kiraVersion → kiraSpace (title stays "Kira"), activitybar container kiraVersionReview → kiraSpaceReview (title "Kira Space"), views kiraSpace.graph and kiraSpace.review.
The comment controller is now kiraSpace.reviewComments, the menu group is kiraSpace@1, and the virtual-document URI scheme is kira-space (when clauses use resourceScheme == kira-space).
The extension's socketPath() in connection.ts now uses KIRA_SPACE_HOME and ~/.kira-space instead of KIRA_HOME and ~/.kira-studio.
The search conformance fixture packages/git-core/testdata/searchConformance.json is shared by the TS matcher test and the Go test apps/kira-space/internal/gitsearch/conformance_test.go; its sample addresses became fixture@kira-space.test.
The .vsix ships inside the app bundle and installs from the Connected editors pane, so packaging reused the existing five-link chain, retargeted at apps/kira-space/bin/kira-space.vsix → Kira Space.app/Contents/Resources/.
The build:vsix task now lives in apps/kira-space/build/Taskfile.yml. Its sources are apps/kira-space-vscode/**, packages/git-{core,ipc,ui}/src/** and packages/kira-ui/src/** (a real build dependency the plan omitted), and it generates apps/kira-space/bin/kira-space.vsix.
The build:vsix task and the vsix-copy blocks were removed from the apps/kira-studio Taskfiles (build and darwin); the Kira Space darwin Taskfile mirrors the copy-and-fail-loudly block with kira-space.vsix naming.
apps/kira-space/internal/gitvsix/install.go sets vsixFileName to "kira-space.vsix".
bun run package:vscode writes apps/kira-space/bin/kira-space.vsix, and the extension bundles are built under apps/kira-space-vscode/dist/.
scripts/verify-packaging.sh: S9 targets apps/kira-space-vscode/package.json and apps/kira-space/build/config.yml; the vsix check (A6) moved from the Kira Studio artifact block to a new Kira Space block with A1/A3/A5/A6/N2 plus A4/N3 for the .dmg. The Kira Space bundle id is com.kirathecat.kira-space.
bun run verify:packaging skips the A1/A3/A5/A6/N2/A4/N3 checks when no built .app/.dmg exists, while the S1/S2/S5/S9 static checks still run for both apps.
scripts/sign-bundle.sh needs no change because it takes the app dir and name as $1/$2, and package:space already calls it with apps/kira-space "Kira Space".
Route changes to .github/workflows/ through docs/pending-changes/ when the session cannot push workflow files (e.g. the Linux sandbox, per docs/DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md).
The release.yml patch, staged at docs/pending-changes/.github__workflows__release.yml.patch, drops the release job's stale apps/kira-studio-vscode/package.json version-stamp step (path no longer exists after the directory rename) and adds a release-space job.
The release-space job needs [test-matrix, db-compat, release] so it uploads onto the same draft release the release job creates instead of racing to create a second one. It has its own Wails bindings cache, version-stamp step (kira-space/build/config.yml and kira-space-vscode/package.json), runs package:space and verify:packaging, and asserts bundle id com.kirathecat.kira-space.
pr.yml needs no change for the rename, since it never references the vscode extension path and never builds a packaged app or dmg.
README.md and docs/ARCHITECTURE.md still describe apps/kira-studio-vscode / "Kira Version" in several places; the documentation update is deliberately deferred to §7.3, Part 4 of the plan.
The gitignored Wails-generated apps/kira-space/frontend/bindings models.ts can carry stale kiraVersion.log.level doc comments; it self-corrects on the next wails3 task common:generate:bindings -clean=true.

### v1.9 P100 Part 4 the icon, the docs, and the phase-closing audit
Kira Space's app icon SVG (apps/kira-space/build/appicon.icon/Assets/kira_icon_vector.svg) uses the repo's blues (#3B9BE8/#0A5FA8) for its #bg gradient stops instead of tan (#D2A97C/#A3794C).
Kira Space's icon replaces all four client glyphs (database stack, SQL cell grid, document braces, message queue) with the commit-graph mark copied verbatim from apps/kira-space-vscode/resources/icon.svg, so app and extension share one drawing; JSON-document and Kafka/SQS marks say nothing on a git icon.
In the Kira Space icon SVG, the commit-graph mark is placed with translate(232 700) scale(8.5) rotate(-6) translate(-12 -12) in the open bottom-left gap, because at dead centre it sat behind the cat's opaque #FDFDFB body fill, which paints later, and was invisible.
Kira Space's icon SVG must contain no database-client glyph and no tan colors (#D2A97C, #A3794C); Kira Studio's SVG at apps/kira-studio/build/appicon.icon/ must stay unchanged.
The icon PNGs are rendered through Playwright's headless Chromium because the container has no system SVG rasterizer.
apps/kira-space/build/appicon.png is 1024×1024 and apps/kira-space-vscode/resources/icon.png is 128×128; both are rasterized from the full-colour kira_icon_vector.svg, not the small currentColor activity-bar glyph, matching the pre-P100 precedent.
Docs cite gitrpc's 51 request methods and ContractVersion 40, no longer list startupfail as a git package, and give the command count as 47 (len of package.json's contributes.commands).
Kira Studio's main.go still binds LinkService although it has no live caller since git-ui's commit-body link left with the git module; docs/ARCHITECTURE.md records it as a Known open item rather than removing it.
The review.db storage path in docs uses ${KIRA_SPACE_HOME} instead of ${KIRA_HOME}.
apps/kira-studio/tests/ui/support/gitStreamMock.ts and graphStreamFixture.ts were removed as dead test-support files with no importers.
docs/PACKAGING.md has a section "§8 Kira Space packaging"; the .vsix/Connected-editors description was removed from Kira Studio's sections; Kira Space has its own apps/kira-space/README.md, with git sections moved out of the root README.
scripts/setup.sh regenerates Wails bindings for both Kira Studio and Kira Space, because otherwise a fresh clone's first bun run typecheck fails on missing apps/kira-space/frontend/src/bridge/*.ts.
package.json has predev:space and prepackage:space hooks so dev:space and package:space do not run against a stale or absent wails3 CLI on a fresh clone; bun honours pre<name> hooks for colon-containing script names.
Kira Space's gitrpc contract version is 40 in both Go (gitrpc.ContractVersion in contract.go) and TypeScript (CONTRACT_VERSION in validate.ts), and TestContractVersion_Is40 guards it.
The one-time cross-DB settings import (~/.kira-studio/kira.db to ~/.kira-space/kira.db) was scoped out in Part 1 per the plan's named fallback, so no kiraVersion.*-seeded settings row is ever migrated.
GitRepoSettingsRepo reads and writes settings under the kiraSpace.* keys, covered by TestRepoSettings_GetSetRoundTrip and five sibling tests.
TestDomainPackagesDoNotImportBridge (layering_test) enforces that domain packages do not import bridge, in both apps (44 non-exempt packages combined).
Kira Studio contains no git Go code or git frontend code after P100; remaining hits are historical comments, and no Git/Repo/CodeWorkspace routes remain in bridge/index.ts or internal/bridge/*.go.
Never import another app's internal/ package from Kira Space code.
The identifier kiraVersion was renamed; no live identifiers remain in extension/app source, and historical docs/SPEC mentions are left uncorrected by convention.
Give every Vue component exactly one <script> block.
Kira Space has no build/test coverage in .github/workflows/pr.yml; this is blocked by the .github/workflows/ push-scope limitation, and a patch would need to go through docs/pending-changes/.
bun run lint:dead (knip) has a baseline of 6 duplicate-export and 6 configuration-hint findings, unchanged since P100 Parts 2-3.
bun run verify:packaging skips checks A1/A3/A4/A5/A6/N2/N3 for both apps when no built .app/.dmg exists, the documented precedent in every P100 part.
P99 and P100, both four-part phases, close with no separate whole-phase result rollup section.

### v1.9 P102 Reclassify root `package.json`'s `dependencies`/`devDependencies` split by actual import reachability; add the xterm...
Vite bundles by import reachability, not by which package.json list a package sits in, so a wrong dependencies/devDependencies placement is a doc-accuracy bug, not a build bug.
Root package.json: packages imported by shipped app code (apps/kira-studio/frontend/src/**, excluding tests) belong in dependencies; build, lint, test and type tooling stays in devDependencies.
P102 moved 11 packages from devDependencies to dependencies in root package.json: vue, vite, @vitejs/plugin-vue, tailwindcss, @tailwindcss/vite, vue-tsc, sql-formatter, simple-icons, @wailsio/runtime, @faker-js/faker and @vscode/codicons.
vite, @vitejs/plugin-vue, tailwindcss and @tailwindcss/vite are not imported by .ts/.vue files; they are reachable via apps/*/frontend/vite.config.ts and packages/theme/src/base.css's @import "tailwindcss".
vue-tsc was moved to dependencies without import-reachability justification: no runtime or build-script import exists, and the frontend build script is plain vite build with no type-check step.
sql-formatter is imported in views/console/sqlFormatterEntry.ts, which format.ts loads via dynamic import().
@wailsio/runtime is used type-only via bridge/port.ts, with tsconfig.web.json path-mapping onto /wails/runtime.js.
@faker-js/faker is imported from '@faker-js/faker/locale/en' in dynamic-import entry files fakerEntry.ts (kira-studio grid fakeData and packages/api-core http/dynamic), used by grid Generate Data and HTTP/gRPC dynamic request values.
@vscode/codicons has no JS/TS import but is a runtime dependency because packages/theme/src/base.css and packages/git-ui/src/icons/codicon.css CSS-@import its codicon.css into the shipped bundle.
mariadb and pg stay in devDependencies because they are imported only by test fixture support (packages/db-fixtures/support/{mariadb,postgres}.ts), not shipped app code.
typescript, @biomejs/biome, knip, @playwright/test, @types/*, testcontainers, @testcontainers/*, @typescript/native-preview, @vscode/vsce and bun-types remain in devDependencies as build/lint/test/type tooling.
@xterm/addon-web-links is pinned exactly at 0.12.0, following the exact-pin convention of @xterm/addon-fit@0.11.0; no peerDependencies entry pins it below @xterm/xterm@6.0.0.
The xterm Terminal/FitAddon setup lives in views/terminal/terminalRenderer.ts's getOrCreateTerminal, not in TerminalPanel.vue (tab UI chrome); WebLinksAddon is loaded there via term.loadAddon(new WebLinksAddon()) beside the fit addon.
apps/kira-space/frontend/src/views/repo/terminalRenderer.ts is a byte-identical duplicate of kira-studio's terminalRenderer.ts, so edits must be applied to both copies until P103 hoists them to packages/workbench.

### v1.9 P103 Part 1 `packages/workbench` and the verbatim tier
packages/workbench uses the alias @workbench/*, following packages/theme's vite-alias/tsconfig-paths precedent rather than packages/git-ui's exports map, because its files import @theme/*, which only resolves through the consuming app's own alias table.
P100 split Kira Studio and Kira Space but left their bases duplicated rather than shared, because P100's scope was extraction, not dedup.
The byte-identical theme tier (tokens.css, base.css, 18 components/ui shadcn-vue components, lib/utils.ts, 12 identical theme/primitives ports, stickyBand.ts, connColor.ts, wrapSelection.ts, CodiconIcon.vue) was already hoisted to packages/theme in P100 Part 2 (122 files).
ContextMenu.vue and AppTooltip.vue moved to packages/workbench with their hand-rolled internals untouched, because P104 reworks one shared copy after P103, which is why P103 is sequenced first.
P103 Part 1 moved no Go files; the Go shell hoist, including internal/terminal, belongs to Part 3 of P103.
packages/workbench holds 28 files (~2,350 lines) across components, state, editor, terminal, bridge, shortcuts, util and testing/unit, and is wired into both knip.json workspace blocks, check-tokens.sh's kira- usage scan, the root workspace list, both apps' vite.config.ts/tsconfig.json and their unit/e2e test project configs.
workbench.css carries only an @source "./"; directive because Tailwind v4 does not content-scan a sibling package by default; without it ConfirmDialog.vue's classes such as m-0 and whitespace-pre-wrap compile away silently.
monacoTheme.ts in packages/workbench holds MonacoModule, KIRA_EDITOR_THEME and the cssVar/normalizeColor/rgbaToHex8 apparatus extracted from each app's editor/monaco.ts; monaco.ts stays per-app (deferred to Part 2) and re-exports MonacoModule and KIRA_EDITOR_THEME.
cssVar has no consumer outside monacoTheme.ts in either app, so it is not re-exported from the apps' monaco.ts; bun run lint:dead flags such a re-export as an unused export.
The shared terminalRenderer.ts takes a TerminalRendererDeps parameter (appearance(), onTerminalOutput(), writeTerminal()) on getOrCreateTerminal/applyTerminalAppearance, so it never depends on either app's private state/settings or state/terminals store shape; TerminalView.vue (Studio) and RepoTerminalView.vue (Space) build and pass it.
state/contextMenu.ts moved to packages/workbench in Part 1 rather than Part 2, because ContextMenu.vue and contextMenuKeys.ts depend on it, and plan §5.3 specifies moving it whole with no parameterization.
Kira Space keeps terminalRenderer.ts and terminalRendererLoader.ts under views/repo/ while Kira Studio keeps them under views/terminal/, so a same-path sweep missed them.
Never hoist state/pinia.ts or state/queryClient.ts into the shared workbench package; keep them duplicated per app, because bun test runs both apps' unit specs in one process with one module cache and Pinia keys stores by id string alone, so hoisting made kira-space's 'tabs' store resolve to kira-studio's and broke 9 kira-space unit tests.
In production the two apps are separate Vite builds with no shared JS runtime, so the singleton collision only affects the shared-process bun test run.
queryClient.ts was un-hoisted pre-emptively because it has the same module-level singleton shape and shared-process hazard (QueryClient cache key collision).
Duplicating singleton modules per app rather than hoisting follows the established precedent of state/terminals.ts and editor/monaco.ts.
state/tabRuntime.ts stays hoisted despite its singleton shape, because it is a self-gated callback fan-out (each cleanup no-ops on a tabId it doesn't own), not an identity registry, and shared terminal/terminalRenderer.ts imports it directly.
Deferred to Part 2: tests/ui/support/{ipcChannels,mockRuntime}.ts (real per-app divergence), state/terminals.ts, state/terminalTabs.ts, editor/monaco.ts, and pinia.ts/queryClient.ts; Part 2 should consider a factory-function redesign for pinia/queryClient.
packages/workbench/src/testing/unit/*.ts imports bun:test, so it is excluded via a narrow exclude in both apps' tsconfig.tests.json, whose broad packages/workbench/src/**/*.ts include glob would otherwise pull it into the Playwright project (types: node).
monacoTheme.ts cannot be split further because KIRA_EDITOR_THEME must stay synchronously available (MonacoHost.vue and ResponseDiffDialog.vue read it as a plain prop value); this causes an informational Rolldown INEFFECTIVE_DYNAMIC_IMPORT warning costing a few KB.
The knip lint:dead run shows a 'vue extension not registered' configuration hint for packages/workbench, the same hint other .vue-bearing knip workspaces carry.

### v1.9 P103 Part 2 the parameterized frontend
Each app declares its own tab-kind union (Kira Studio 12, Kira Space 5, with terminal shared) instead of one shared 16-member tabKindSchema, which forced each app to stub the other's kinds.
packages/workbench owns only the generic TabKindDef/TabViewMap contract for tab kinds.
Kira Studio's Go RenderableTabKinds (apps/kira-studio/internal/storage/model/tabs.go) no longer lists the four repo-* kinds Studio cannot produce.
go-ts-vocabulary-parity.spec.ts is two checks, one per app, each passing on its own vocabulary rather than passing only because both sides were equally wrong.
packages/shared knip.json treats every export as public API, so domain logic moved from packages/shared into app-internal files becomes subject to lint:dead, which then flags unused private consts.
createTabsStore<K, R, E>(host) in packages/workbench/src/state/createTabsStore.ts owns the shared tabs-store skeleton (persistableTabs, saveIfChanged, openTab, closeTab, activateTab, moveTab, stepTab, patchTabState) that both apps' state/tabs.ts used to duplicate.
createTabsStore exposes a hook surface for per-app divergence: persistable, onCleanup, seedWorkspaceKeys, onHydrated, onOpened, onClosed, onDuplicated, fallbackWorkspaceKey, extend.
The extend(actions): E hook of createTabsStore merges extra named actions onto the store's return object, so Studio call sites such as tabsStore.findDataTab(id) work as store methods unchanged.
createOpenTerminalTab<K>() in createTerminalTabs.ts is the shared terminal-tab opener hoisted from the near-identical per-app versions.
packages/workbench/tsconfig.json exists only so bun test can resolve real (non-type-only) cross-package @shared imports from packages/workbench/src.
createLayoutStore<E>, createSettingsStore<S>() and createTerminalsStore are the shared factories for the layout, settings and terminals stores.
contextMenu.ts needs no store factory because it is identical between the two apps with no per-app divergence.
Both apps' state/terminals.ts are byte-identical, and createTerminalsStore takes no extend.
Kira Space's state/coderepos.ts local canonicalPath duplicate was folded into @shared/domain/path, which has been the single definition since P100 Part 2.
Never make a store factory's extend hook optional with a defaulted type parameter, because a call leaving it at the Record<string, never> default (by omission or by giving another type parameter explicitly) makes Pinia's setup-store return type collapse every property to never.
The extend/never collapse error surfaces far from its cause, for example as useLayoutStore(pinia).hydrateLayout not callable at a main.ts call site.
An inferred empty object type for extend works, but an explicit Record<string, never> or Record<string, unknown> type argument breaks Pinia's store typing.
extend is required in every store factory, including createTabsStore; createSettingsStore is curried on S (the app's Section union) so the inner call carries no explicit type argument and E is inferred from the real extend argument.
The P103 Part 2 plan drops a settings search feature because no search affordance exists in either settings dialog, so building one would be a feature rather than dedup.
SettingsDialog.vue was split into a shared SettingsShell.vue in packages/workbench/src/components/, generic over T extends Record<string, Record<string, unknown>>, owning the frame, nav and the baseline/draft/diffSection/pendingPatch/isDirty/isAtDefault/resetLeaf/validate engine.
Each app's settings panes live in workbench/settings/*.vue (Kira Studio 8 panes, Kira Space 4), extracted verbatim with markup, classes and data-testids unchanged, because about 331 class-based Playwright selectors depend on them.
Shared workbench components (WorkbenchShell, TitleBar, StatusBar, TabStrip, MainView) live in packages/workbench/src/components/, generic over a provided typed WorkbenchHost<K> plus named slots; each app's workbench/ files are thin wrappers that provide the host and fill the slots. No new hand-rolled primitive is added; each app's own button markup stays in the app for P104 to swap once.
createCoreControl<S, L, T>(bindings) in packages/workbench/src/bridge/createCoreControl.ts covers 20 bound-call methods across 7 services that were byte-for-byte identical between Kira Studio's studioControl and Kira Space's control objects.
The 20 shared methods are settings/layout get-all and set-plus-changed, the quit and close-window flush handshakes, the folder picker, tabsList/tabsSave, the five terminal methods, and linkOpenExternal.
CoreBindings is a structural interface, not an adapter: each app's generated @bindings/* service modules (Settings, Layout, Tabs, Lifecycle, Terminal, Files, Link) satisfy it by shape, with no per-app glue code and no change to Wails binding generation.
After the move, Kira Studio's studioControl has 94 methods left (114 total minus 20 shared) and Kira Space's spaceControl has 24 left (44 total minus 20 shared).
Kira Studio's bridge/index.ts method-count comment was stale (said 67, actually 114), so verify method counts by enumerating the real file.
In CoreBindings, the tabs.Save tabs field is typed as scalar unknown rather than unknown[], because unknown[] failed the structural check against each app's TabsService.Save taking TabRecord[] (a large discriminated union).
Typing problems in shared bindings only surface when bun run typecheck runs, not by inspection; typecheck covers 8 parallel projects.
P103 Part 2 is sequenced before P104 because ContextMenu.vue and AppTooltip.vue sit in both scopes, so deduping first means P104 reworks one shared copy once.
state/pinia.ts and state/queryClient.ts stay duplicated per app; hoisting them into a shared package was declined.
Each of state/pinia.ts and state/queryClient.ts is 5-20 lines of pure library construction with no per-app option divergence (both queryClient.ts are byte-identical), so a factory would save almost nothing.
Hoisting the Pinia singleton (export const pinia = createPinia()) into shared code collided both apps' stores onto one Pinia instance within bun test's single shared module cache, breaking 9 of Kira Space's unit tests.
A per-app factory such as createAppPinia() would avoid the collision but was rejected: the saving is marginal and a later edit could turn the function back into a shared constant and reintroduce the bug.
state/terminals.ts and editor/monaco.ts follow a pre-P103 'duplicate, don't hoist' precedent for low-value shared surfaces.
Scope left out of a phase stays out entirely and is never half-implemented (CLAUDE.md).
Part 3 is a distinct, Go-only workstream (the shell/terminal/event hoist), independent of Parts 1-2.
A wrong class or never-typed prop in a shared component fails silently in test:visual/test:ui rather than at typecheck, and test:visual alone takes minutes per iteration.
TabStrip's '+' button menu differs per app (Kira Studio: data connection/request/console; Kira Space: repo/terminal), so it is kept as a slot and never unified.
StatusBar's keep-awake toggle is Kira Studio-only, because Kira Space has no adapter connections to keep awake; it sits behind a slot only the Kira Studio wrapper fills.
The shared field-level style vocabulary (.field, .field-head, .helper-text, .field-error, .sec-label, and .settings-pane { display: contents }) lives in packages/workbench/src/workbench.css.
.section-subhead has no style rule anywhere in the repo and was deliberately left unstyled, since adding one would be new styling outside the phase's 'move code, don't add it' scope.
Keep settings panes mounted for the dialog's lifetime (v-show, not v-if), because a v-if-gated pane destroys its validator and field error on tab switch, silently re-enabling Save on an invalid draft in a hidden section.
Neither app's real settings dialog onDismiss has a discard-confirm guard; both are a plain emit('close'), unlike the plan's sketch, and it was not changed.
The settings dialog footer differs between apps: Kira Space's action wrapper has class="end" and style gap var(--kira-s-2), Kira Studio's doesn't; it is kept as an app-supplied #footer scoped slot.
Implement the whole phase first, then test once and fix what is found (CLAUDE.md).
bun run test:visual has a pre-existing baseline of 5 failing specs: connection-dialog, console, data-view, schema-dialog, workbench; they are not a regression and not recorded as a Known open item.
bun run lint:dead reports a pre-existing baseline of 6 'Duplicate exports' findings and 7 configuration hints.
Builds (bun run build and build:space) emit pre-existing advisories: INEFFECTIVE_DYNAMIC_IMPORT on monacoTheme.ts and chunk-size warnings.
The settings classes moved to the shared stylesheet (section-pane, field-error, helper-text, sec-label) are present in each app's built dist/assets/index-*.css.
Test baselines after P103 Part 2: unit tests 1535 pass across 156 files, test:ui 279 passed, test:ui:space 20 passed.

### v1.9 P103 Part 3 the Go shell, terminal and event hoist
Kira Space's internal/shell has the full per-window flush handshake; shell/quit.go and shell/closeflush.go differ between the two apps only by the bridge import path.
Kira Studio's Dialogs covers three panels versus Kira Space's one, AttachSystemWake is Studio-only, and Studio's menu is fuller.
internal/buildinfo is not hoisted because its Version is an -ldflags -X target on each app's own import path, so one shared symbol could not carry two versions.
storage/migrations/embed.go is not hoisted because //go:embed resolves only inside its own package directory.
Bound Wails services are not hoisted, because a bound service's types drive binding generation and therefore the frontend's @bindings/* paths; their shared dependencies move instead. internal/bridge/{lifecycle.go,link.go,tabs.go,layout.go} stay for this reason.
config/paths.go is left untouched because it is already parameterized through internal/kirapaths and only three literals remain.
Each app's shell residue lives in apps/<app>/internal/appshell, a name distinct from repo-root internal/shell so one main.go can import both without an alias.
Repo-root internal/shell holds the generic shell behind four seams: Config, Signaller, WindowStore, and WindowRecord/WindowBounds.
internal/terminal is hoisted to repo root; the app-specific TERM_PROGRAM strings became package vars TermProgram and TermProgramVersion, which each app's main.go must set before the first Registry.Open.
internal/appevent holds the Emitter interface, the Events core (Signal/SignalTo/Broadcast, NewEvents) and the six channel constants; each app's appcore.Emitter is a type alias to appevent.Emitter and each bridge.Events embeds *appevent.Events.
Kira Studio's bridge.Events keeps its own emit appcore.Emitter field for Attach's five producer subscriptions and SettingsChanged, which the shared core does not expose.
AttachCloseFlush no longer takes a separate emit parameter, since NewCloseFlushCoordinator takes the Signaller directly.
Both apps' main.go use a windowStore/toShellWindowRecord adapter to convert each app's storage/model types into shell's shared seams.
Both apps' layering_test.go exemption was renamed from internal/shell to internal/appshell; internal/appshell is the sole remaining bridge-import exemption in TestDomainPackagesDoNotImportBridge in both apps.
storage/model/time.go moved to repo-root internal/kiratime, and all model.NowISO/FormatISO/ParseISO call sites were retargeted to kiratime across 28 files in both apps.
config env.go, prod.go and prod_default.go moved to repo-root internal/kirapaths; each app's config package keeps one-line wrappers such as IsDev() calling kirapaths.IsDev().
The 4-commit Part 3 sequence is not bisect-safe: 99b713e, 85a57e7 and 2fc80da leave the tree not fully building until f94c5e0.
internal/storage/db.go, storage/migrate.go, storage/model/window.go and bridge/settings.go are not shared in Part 3 because of real per-app differences: config.KiraHome() vs KiraSpaceHome(), Studio-only Mode/NormalizeMode, Studio-only PushCacheConfig.
Each app keeps its own Events/Deps residue after the shared core of internal/bridge/events.go and the Emitter alias in internal/appcore/deps.go were hoisted.
In the shell package's quit test, the test must wait for flushThenQuit's async goroutine to populate the pending map before calling q.Flushed, otherwise the ack races a nil map and is swallowed as an unknown key.
docs/DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md documents a --no-verify exception to the pre-commit hook for a fresh worktree, where typecheck fails only on missing Wails-generated @bindings/* modules until scripts/setup.sh codegen runs for both apps.
The .githooks/pre-push hook runs go build ./..., bun run lint:go, then bun run lint:dead; lint:dead fails in a fresh worktree on unresolved @bindings/* imports, and the hook header documents --no-verify for that case.
Server-mode binaries (go build -tags server) need a frontend/dist/index.html to satisfy //go:embed all:frontend/dist; a gitignored placeholder works. They run with KIRA_HOME/KIRA_SPACE_HOME, KIRA_INSECURE_SECRETS=1 and WAILS_SERVER_HOST set, and answer GET /health.
Implement the whole phase, then test once, and fix pre-existing failures unless genuinely outside the phase's scope, in which case name them (CLAUDE.md).

### v1.9 P103 Part 4 `model.Settings` composition, the settings schema split, and the audit
Repo-root package internal/appsettings holds the shared settings section types (Appearance, Git, AdvancedCore and Patch variants), defaults, validators and SQL helpers (Leaf/LeafValid, Upsert*/Read*); each app composes its own Settings and its own GetAll/Set.
Both apps embed appsettings.AdvancedCore/AdvancedCorePatch into AdvancedSettings/AdvancedPatch; regenerated Wails bindings were unchanged (gitLogLevel stays a flat string/string|null field in generated TS), so the embedding was kept.
Bindings are regenerated with wails3 task common:generate:bindings -f; the Taskfile's generate:bindings target already passes -clean=true, and -clean is not a valid flag at the wails3 task level.
The frontend never imports generated binding models directly; bridge/index.ts reads Settings/SettingsPatch from each app's own state/settingsDomain.ts, narrowed with trust<T>.
packages/shared/domain/settings.ts holds only shared settings pieces: row density, FONT_SIZE_RANGE, FETCH_AUTO_INTERVAL_MINUTES_RANGE, appearance and git schemas, gitLogLevel schema, and HTTP_VERSIONS/httpVersionSchema/HttpVersion.
HTTP_VERSIONS/httpVersionSchema/HttpVersion stay in packages/shared because packages/shared/domain/http.ts depends on them, and a shared package may not import apps/*/frontend/src/state/*.
Each app owns frontend/src/state/settingsDomain.ts composing its own settingsSchema, settingsPatchSchema and defaultSettings: Kira Studio has 8 sections (appearance, data, cache, advanced, git, api, dbMcp, claudeCode), Kira Space has 3 (appearance, advanced, git).
Kira Space has no data, cache, api, dbMcp or claudeCode settings sections and its frontend does not reference them, since its Go backend never sends them.
Knip treats packages/shared as an always-exempt entry tier (entry: **/*.ts), while app-local files are usage-traced, so moving schemas into app settingsDomain.ts exposes unused exports; raw zod schema consts there are not exported.
The lint:dead baseline is 6 duplicate-export pairs and 7 configuration hints with zero unused-export findings.
Kira Studio's Git settings section is vestigial and could not be removed Go-side in P100 Part 1; the schema split makes removing it a one-commit change.
Fix a failing lint finding on the spot, per CLAUDE.md.
A shared package never imports apps/*/internal/..., per CLAUDE.md.
Each app (Kira Studio and Kira Space) keeps its own state/pinia.ts, because a single shared createPinia() instance made both apps' same-named stores ('tabs', 'settings', ...) share one Pinia registry in the shared bun test process.
bun run test:unit runs both apps' spec files in one Bun process, so state shared across the apps leaks between their tests, even though each app's real runtime is a separate Vite/Wails bundle with its own module graph.
state/queryClient.ts was hoisted to packages/workbench, as it was byte-identical in both apps.
state/terminals.ts is intentionally code-identical in both apps as a by-design host-function shim.
internal/bridge/{lifecycle,link}.go and internal/buildinfo/buildinfo.go remain duplicated across the apps as declined moves in the §2.3 decline table; internal/config/env.go stays duplicated as a one-line wrapper.
The layering test TestDomainPackagesDoNotImportBridge runs in both apps (27 subtests each); its exemption sets were not grown.
biome.json has a noRestrictedImports block forbidding packages/workbench/** from importing **/apps/** or @/*, so the workbench package imports nothing app-local.
Every component has exactly one <script> block across both frontends and packages workbench, theme, git-ui and kira-ui.
Never change Pinia store ids 'tabs', 'settings', 'layout', 'contextMenu', 'terminals', 'confirmDialog', 'tooltip' (CLAUDE.md store-id-stability rule).
The P103 refactor cut net 19,252 lines across both apps' frontend/src and internal/ (6,076 insertions, 25,328 deletions), well past the ~3,800 target.
The ui-timing project of test:ui (Kira Studio) intermittently misses perf.spec.ts's p95 scroll-frame gate (<80) and slick-grid.spec.ts's 150ms select-all gate under sandbox load; the thresholds are documented as sandbox-cadence-tolerant.
The apps/kira-space/internal/gitsock package has load-sensitive flaky tests (fsnotify timing, e.g. TestMatrix_M3_FullIndependence and TestRevoke_DoesNotDisturbAnotherClient); whole-package reruns can hang to Go's 10-minute timeout.
bun run test:visual has 5 known pre-existing failures (~1% pixel ratio each); a sixth failure would be a regression.
The pre-commit hook runs bun run lint and bun run typecheck; the pre-push hook runs go build ./..., golangci-lint run and bun run lint:dead.

### v1.9 P104 Delete every hand-rolled UI primitive for shadcn-vue's own components, and normalize spacing/sizing onto Tailwind's d...
P104 deletes every hand-rolled UI primitive (theme/primitives/*.vue wrappers) and repoints call sites directly at shadcn-vue components in components/ui/*, with no wrapper layer and no hand-rolled fallback for any component.
The no-fallback rule is the user's explicit override of P99's precedent, not a default judgment call of the chapter.
P104 merges the primitive swap and the spacing/sizing normalization onto Tailwind's default scale into one pass so each file is touched once, not by two phases.
P99 fetched 18 shadcn-vue components into components/ui/ but never called them from app-level files, and it preserved 425 arbitrary-bracket [...var(--kira-*)...] spacing/sizing utilities across 115 files verbatim under its pixel-identical gate.
theme/base.css's @theme block maps only --color-* and --radius-kira-* tokens, not spacing, so P104 extends it to a coherent set as needed.
P104 re-opens three cases P99 declined (Checkbox, workbench/ContextMenu.vue, AppTooltip.vue); each must be solved by composing or modifying reka-ui/shadcn-vue primitives, not kept hand-rolled.
CheckboxRoot renders <button role="checkbox"> rather than a real <input>, which breaks Playwright .check() calls and native form semantics; P104 accepts this and updates about 331 class-based Playwright selectors.
The point-anchored context menu is built by layering a positioning wrapper over PopoverAnchor/DropdownMenuContent, because reka-ui's model is trigger-anchored while the app's context menu is a point-anchored singleton.
The tooltip's rearm-delay/singleton behavior is built on TooltipRoot/TooltipProvider instead of the former directive-plus-singleton AppTooltip.
P104 allows styling and DOM shape to change where the swap requires it, as long as functionality is preserved. New test:visual baselines are recorded per changed surface with the reason stated per baseline, not chased back to zero diff.
ConfirmDialog.vue's Dialog was bound only by :open, so it claimed an early fixed DOM position from app boot and stayed under any dialog opened later, because reka's DialogPortal teleports content to the end of body at open time. Gating the Dialog itself on v-if fixes this, mirroring DbMcpApprovalDialog.vue.
Reka's TooltipTrigger opens on pointermove, not pointerenter/mouseenter, so a .hover() at the pointer's already-current position dispatches no real pointer event and does not open the tooltip.
The shared tooltip test helper (tests/ui/support/tooltip.ts, assertTooltipShows/tooltipContent) uses a move-to-a-neutral-corner-then-hover retry loop bounded by an overall deadline, because a single hover or a wait held past 600ms did not reliably open reka's tooltip.
The live data-kira-tip attribute remains only for the two tooltipAttrs() writers (SlickGridHost.vue, ConsoleSlickGrid.vue), the grid-header bridge (AttributeTooltip.vue, state/tooltip.ts), and tooltips.spec.ts's geometry test; there is no other live consumer.
After P104, 15 components/ui/* sets survive, each with outside importers; scroll-area and context-menu were deleted because they had no honest consumer. ARCHITECTURE.md line 35 states 17 fetched, 15 surviving.
primitives.css has 152 selector rules covering 53 classes, each named in ARCHITECTURE.md line 35.
The bun run lint:dead baseline is 6 duplicate-export pairs and 7 configuration hints, which existed before P104.
The P104 plan is at docs/v1.9/plans/P104-primitive-swap.md.
The Studio UI Playwright config uses fullyParallel: true and workers: '100%', which causes cross-file worker-contention flakes in this sandbox; the failing tests pass when re-run in isolation.
Visual baselines captured outside CI's ubuntu-latest image show glyph-rendering noise (about 0.01 diff ratio), documented in ARCHITECTURE.md; it is not chased to zero.
A --color-muted custom-property collision exists between base.css (foreground-gray) and shadcn-bridge.css (shadcn's semantic background token). It predates P104 and is tracked as follow-up P110 in docs/v1.9/SPEC.md.
P104 re-recorded all 5 Studio visual baselines (workbench, console, data-view, connection-dialog, schema-dialog) because the primitive swap changed their rendering. The command is bun run test:visual:update:studio.
The data-view checkbox is now CheckboxRoot's <button role="checkbox">, not a native <input>. The workbench splitter is now reka's Splitter*, and schema-dialog tree rows use @tanstack/vue-virtual.
With the a11y: off override for **/*.vue removed, biome check reports 254 errors across 13 rules, against P99's 255 findings across 86 files. P105 starts from this 254/13-rule breakdown. The largest class is noNoninteractiveTabindex (81), then noStaticElementInteractions (62) and useKeyWithClickEvents (46).
Every components/ui component ships type="button" and correct roles, which sharply reduced useButtonType and useFocusableInteractive findings. Adopting ui/label reduced noLabelWithoutControl to 4.
noNoninteractiveTabindex is the largest a11y finding class because of the <span tabindex="0"> disabled-hover wrappers described in §6.3, which exist so tooltips work on disabled controls.
The pre-commit hook runs bun run lint and bun run typecheck. bun run lint consists of Biome plus check-tokens.sh.

### v1.9 P105 Fix the remaining `.vue` accessibility findings and delete the `a11y: off` override
P105 is sequenced last, after P104's full primitive swap to shadcn-vue components, because fixing a11y findings earlier would mean hand-fixing markup that P104 deletes and rewrites.
P97 turned lint/a11y/* off for **/*.vue via a biome.json override rather than hand-fixing 255 findings across 85 files that P99's shadcn-vue migration was expected to rewrite.
P99 only wired reka-ui into the existing hand-rolled wrapper layer rather than swapping to shadcn-vue's own components, so the a11y finding count stayed effectively unmoved (255 across 86 files).
Deleting the a11y: off entry from the biome.json **/*.vue override is P105's own acceptance test; the override keeps only its unrelated useVueHyphenatedAttributes and noNonNullAssertion entries.
P105 was originally landed as P101 and renumbered to P105 to keep table position and number in lockstep, per CLAUDE.md's renumbering rule.
P105 landed as 11 commits merged as 6febddb, fixing 254 findings across 13 rules and 95 files to 0, done sequentially by one subagent because findings share files across rules.
The 79 duplicate span tabindex="0" disabled-tooltip wrappers now use the shared component packages/theme/src/components/ui/tooltip/TooltipDisabledTrigger.vue, which carries a single noNoninteractiveTabindex suppression.
Container-level listeners (keydown, contextmenu, drag-surface) on layout-only divs were moved off templates onto VueUse's useEventListener to clear noStaticElementInteractions.
packages/kira-ui/src/KuiColumnResizeHandle.vue, extracted from CommitGrid.vue's role="separator"/arrow-key pattern, is used by StreamView.vue's ten column-resize handles and CommitGrid.vue's three; StreamView gained keyboard column resizing.
KuiColumnResizeHandle.vue carries a useSemanticElements suppression because an hr cannot carry aria-valuenow or focus.
Dismiss scrims/backdrops (GitPanel, ConsoleSavedMenu, FilterHistoryMenu, FkPreviewPopover, CommandPalette, KuiDialog) use VueUse's onClickOutside instead of click handlers and are aria-hidden="true".
List/tree/menu rows became button type="button" where nothing nests inside them; otherwise they get the implied role (option/treeitem/menuitem), tabindex and keydown enter/space handlers, with data-testid preserved verbatim.
Tab-close controls in ConsoleView.vue, ExplainResultView.vue and TabStrip.vue are now sibling button type="button" elements instead of focusable children nested inside the tab button.
All autofocus attributes were removed; focus relies on KuiDialog's useModalFocus first-focusable-element behavior, with explicit VueUse useFocus/watch where the control is not first.
The InputGroup role="group" was converted to a fieldset, so tests select InputGroup as fieldset rather than div.
InputGroupAddon.vue's click listener is attached via useTemplateRef and VueUse's useEventListener instead of a template @click, avoiding a biome-ignore suppression and following CLAUDE.md's VueUse rule.
Only 2 biome-ignore lint/a11y suppressions exist in apps and packages (TooltipDisabledTrigger.vue noNoninteractiveTabindex and KuiColumnResizeHandle.vue useSemanticElements), under the plan's §17 budget of 3, and the forbidden bound :tabindex="0" evasion never landed.

### v1.9 P106 Normalize every dual-app npm script's naming to explicit `:studio`/`:space` scoping
Root package.json dual-app scripts use explicit scoping: Kira Studio-only scripts carry a :studio suffix, because unscoped names misleadingly read as the default when there are two apps.
The Studio script renames were full renames with no compatibility alias, per CLAUDE.md's no-backwards-compat-shim rule.
Fifteen root scripts got a :studio suffix: dev, predev, build, build:test, package, prepackage, typecheck:tests, typecheck:web, typecheck:unit, typecheck:api-core, test:ui, test:visual, test:visual:update, test:ipc:fe, test:e2e-real (e.g. test:ui→test:ui:studio). Studio-only scripts with no Space counterpart also get the suffix for consistency.
packages/api-core is imported only by apps/kira-studio/frontend, so typecheck:api-core is Studio-only and was renamed typecheck:api-core:studio.
Composite scripts that call a renamed script via bun run must be updated with the rename; e.g. test:ui:studio calls build:test:studio, test:e2e-real:studio calls build:studio, and typecheck calls the four Studio typecheck sub-scripts by their new names.
Genuinely repo-wide scripts stay unscoped: test:go, test:unit, test:compat, test:matrix, lint, lint:go, lint:dead, lint:all, typecheck, format, verify:packaging, generate:wire, because each spans both apps and scoping them would be false naming in reverse.
verify:packaging checks both apps/kira-studio and apps/kira-space bundles; generate:wire regenerates both packages/shared/protocol/wire.fbs and packages/git-ipc/schema/gitwire.fbs.
Space-only scripts build:vscode, package:vscode, test:webview and typecheck:git deliberately remain without a :space suffix, because the rename scope covered only Studio-only scripts.
Frontend-local bun run dev/build lines in both apps' build/Taskfile.yml and build/darwin/Taskfile.yml (dir: frontend) refer to the frontend's own package.json scripts, not the renamed root scripts, so they stay unchanged.
The .github/workflows/ files cannot be pushed per CLAUDE.md, so workflow changes are delivered as patches in docs/pending-changes/ (pr.yml and release.yml), not applied directly.
P106 rename hunks for workflow files were merged into the existing pending-changes patch for each file rather than adding a second conflicting patch: pr.yml (build, test:ui, test:ipc:fe, test:visual) and release.yml (package→package:studio).
Historical SPEC.md and plans/*.md prose is not required to be rewritten for renamed scripts, since it documents what a past phase ran under its own name at the time.
Per CLAUDE.md, fast checks are cheap and fine per-commit, while an expensive suite runs once near phase end.

### v1.9 P107 Fable-audited duplication findings and their consolidation: near-duplicate logic and flow-level duplication across th...
P107 audit and consolidation run as one phase by explicit one-time user instruction: a Fable agent performs the audit and writes the findings document, which is the phase's plan, with no separate methodology plan.
P107 completes only once both the findings document and the consolidation are committed; the original row stopped at findings, and the user redirected it mid-phase before any consolidation phase was opened.
P107 scope is the whole implementation (both apps' Go and TypeScript/Vue, every packages/*), covering tier 1 (small helpers or near-identical functions mergeable by parameters) and tier 2 (flows or chains mirroring another chain, extractable into a shared composable, component or package function).
Each P107 finding must carry file:line for every instance, what is duplicated, what differs, and one concrete named consolidation shape; declines must name the requirement that keeps the copies apart.
P107 excludes generated code (page/wire, gitwire, shared/protocol/wire, git-ipc/src/generated) and cross-language mirrors (mask.go/mask.ts, page/encode.go/encodeFrame.ts, queryplan Go vs planParsers TS) from duplication counting.
P107 consolidation is implemented by one sequential Sonnet subagent in the findings doc's §4 order, with one commit per finding, fast checks per commit, full suites once near the end, and a closing re-run of the exact-body sweep requiring every remaining group to be a named decline.
P107 is sequenced last so it surveys a tree already carrying P103's cross-app hoist and P104's primitive consolidation, and it is independent of P106.
P107 duplicate detection uses CodeGraph index sweeps over .codegraph/codegraph.db (S1 body hash, S2 name collisions, S3 callee fingerprint LCS ratio ≥0.7 with ≥6 callees, S4 file-pair diff), verified per candidate with codegraph_explore and comment-blind diff.
Iteration 2 of P107 added S5 (K=6 normalized-line shingles, maximal repeated blocks ≥8 lines, Vue templates included) and S6 (MinHash/LSH, identifier-blind 4-gram token shingles, functions ≥8 lines, Jaccard ≥0.5) because S1 sees only exact bodies and S3 only call order, missing near-identical blocks inside larger functions and repeated Vue template regions.
P107 iteration 1 (findings in docs/v1.9/plans/P107-duplication-findings.md, tree at c2ce9969) found 25 tier-2 findings, 28 tier-1 findings and 12 declines, and was implemented as ~62 per-finding refactor/fix commits merged into v1.9-integration.
P107 iteration 2 (docs/v1.9/plans/P107-duplication-findings-iter2.md, at ad5c4959) found 28 tier-2, 14 tier-1 findings and 13 declines; 10 were residue of narrowly landed iteration-1 findings, 2 were thin wrappers around iteration-1 helpers, 30 were new, mostly via S5/S6.
In P107 iteration 2 the disabled-tooltip wrapper and the column/pane resize handle were excluded as in-flight because P105 was concurrently extracting them, and were picked up after P105 merged (I2-18, I2-21).
P107 closing-sweep addendum found five candidates (I2-43 to I2-47); four were fixed outright (openTrackedTab, resolveReadGated, sumChunkBytes, sequencerArgs), and in I2-47 WalkFor/ReviewWalkFor were merged into walkForSlot while alreadyHeld was declined because it uses a different map with a different value type.
Every P107 decline names the concrete requirement keeping near-duplicates apart, such as a differing type set, differing error contract, or a generated-code or cross-language boundary, never mere similarity.
Iteration 1 declined typeClassFor ×4 as engine-specific type tables, and declined bound Wails bridge service struct types because P103 §2.3 already covers their binding generation.

### v1.9 P108 Part 1 Whole-codebase code review pre-plan — chunking and stream assignment (review itself: one Opus reviewer per chunk acro...
P108 review uses one single Opus reviewer agent per chunk doing freeform 'any kind of issue or bug' review with care for edge cases, not CLAUDE.md's three-parallel-agent Code review recipe; this is a one-time user-instructed deviation not to be generalized to later phases.
The P108 pre-plan and each chunk's review plan are written by the standing Opus planner, which is CLAUDE.md's default.
Each P108 review chunk is a cohesive subsystem's own files plus its direct callers and callees (one hop out on both edges of the call graph), so the review confirms correctness across the chunk's immediate boundaries.
P108 runs 2 parallel streams, matching CLAUDE.md's P103/P104 2-stream default. A chunk whose one-hop callers/callees overlap a chunk still open in the other stream stays in the same stream or waits, so both streams never edit the same files at once.
Within each P108 stream, chunks run one at a time: an Opus agent writes the chunk review plan, a single Opus agent reviews and reports findings without fixing, then a Sonnet subagent fixes every finding and commits. The next chunk starts only after that fix pass is committed.
P108 is split into the pre-plan (Part 1) plus 19 chunks as Parts 2-20. Stream A (Kira Studio, opened by the shared Go base) is Parts 2-12; stream B (Kira Space, opened by the shared frontend base) is Parts 13-20.
P108 has two cross-stream gates: Part 14 waits for Part 2, and Part 6 (the first Studio chunk holding TS) waits for Part 13.
Edit scope for P108: after a shared base closes, only its owning stream edits it; a fix the other stream needs there is handed to the orchestrator as a fix-only step in the owning stream. The same rule applies to the Go appsettings against shared/domain/settings.ts mirror.
P108 is appended last, after P107, so it reviews the tree in the shape the other phases in the chapter leave it; reviewing code P99-P107 were still changing would re-find what they already fix.
apps/kira-studio/tests/support/encodeFrame.ts imports flatbuffers, which root package.json never declared. Bun 1.3's isolated linker resolves declared dependencies only, so the pre-commit typecheck failed with TS2307 on a fresh install.
flatbuffers is now a root devDependency pinned to packages/shared's version, with a knip.json ignoreDependencies entry because no knip workspace scans apps/kira-studio/tests.
The lint:dead baseline is 6 duplicate exports and 7 hints.
The P108 review is split into 19 chunks rather than about 10 because the tree is about 370k lines of Go/TS/Vue with tests (2,061 files), and ten chunks would average about 37k lines each, too much for one reviewer's edge-case pass. The chunks follow dense call-graph clusters and cut none.
Kira Studio and Kira Space have zero real imports between them, in Go or TS. Every shared edge runs through Go internal/*, the TS workbench/theme/kira-ui packages, ten packages/shared/domain files and protocol/events.ts; the rest of packages/shared is Studio's alone.
CodeGraph's TS name resolution over-links, so cross-app dependency checks must be verified against import lines.
Streams are split by app rather than by language because a Go/TS split would make every IPC boundary cross streams. Load is uneven (about 217k lines against 152k), and rebalancing would put a Studio chunk beside its own one-hop neighbors in the other stream, which is forbidden.
Each app's cross-language mirrors (page wire, mask, git wire, git RPC contract) stay in one stream, and the two-sided ones in one chunk.
Chunk order is bottom-up within each stream (storage, adapters, engine, bridge; git process layer, ops/review, session, RPC, UI logic, components, hosts). The exception is Studio's state/**, a callee of every view, which lands with the shell last and is re-reviewed there.
Two merges were taken in the chunking: the Space desktop host with the VS Code extension, and the console with the per-kind data views. Four further merges were declined on size (about 32-41k lines each).
The codegraph MCP server exposes no codegraph_node tool.

### v1.9 P108 Part 2 Shared Go base and repo tooling
terminal.Session.Close is bounded after SIGKILL by a second wait (closeKillWait): it waits, force-closes ptmx, waits once more, then logs and returns instead of blocking, because a job-control shell's child can sit outside the signalled process group or ignore SIGHUP/SIGKILL and leave readLoop's ptmx.Read blocked.
Force-closing ptmx hangs up the slave but is not guaranteed to unblock Read on darwin, so Session.Close stays bounded regardless.
Registry.CloseAll closes every terminal session concurrently, so quit costs about one grace period total instead of one per open terminal.
In closeflush.go, the flushing flag is reset with flushing.Store(false) right after win.Hide() on the last-window path; this is safe because Hide() never emits WindowClosing. Without the reset, a Dock re-show followed by a second close dropped the pending flush.
CI workflow fixes cannot be edited directly in this setup; they land as patches in docs/pending-changes/ (e.g. .github__workflows__pr.yml.patch).
The pr.yml checks and container-tests jobs run bun run build:space beside every build:studio step, because Kira Space's frontend was never built in CI and both apps' //go:embed all:frontend/dist therefore never compiled there.
The gitclient darwin test path in the pr.yml patch is apps/kira-space/internal/gitclient, since P100 moved it from kira-studio.
verify-packaging.sh check S5 reads both package:studio and package:space script keys, since P106 split the old "package" key.
generate-wire.sh writes gitwire Go output to apps/kira-space/internal/gitwire (namespace gitwire), since P100 moved the package from kira-studio.
notify.OrderedEmitter.Emit holds a dedicated private emit mutex across the whole check-and-deliver, so a later higher-sequence call cannot deliver before an earlier one lands stale. The mutex is not shared with callers' state locks. Its subscribers include dbmcp.ApprovalBroker and gitsock.Broker.
The production subscriber of OrderedEmitter (bridge/events.go Attach) only forwards to Wails EventsEmit and never calls Emit synchronously, so the emit mutex cannot self-deadlock.
rpcstream.Session activeWork stores an activeEntry pointer (wrapping the CancelFunc) and creditGates compares its *creditGate pointer before delete, so cleanup is keyed by identity, not id alone; this prevents a late completion deleting a later request's entry after id reuse.
The one real RPC client, packages/git-ipc/src/rpc.ts, issues request ids monotonically.
sqlitex.BuildDSN escapes the bytes ?, # and % in the path explicitly, because modernc opens with SQLITE_OPEN_URI and would treat them as URI syntax in a KIRA_HOME/KIRA_SPACE_HOME-derived path. net/url's URL.String() is not used since it adds a "//" authority marker that breaks relative paths.
pathsafe.ValidateRelPath's not-exist fallback does an Lstat check and rejects a symlink leaf outright, so a dangling symlink is not accepted like a genuinely missing leaf (TOCTOU risk for codeworkspace's read-only callers).
biome.json's noRestrictedImports override targets apps/kira-space/frontend/src/repo, since P100 moved it from apps/kira-studio.
ipcerr.Error.Error() retries json.Marshal with Details: nil before falling back to the bare Message, so the code the renderer's control.ts wrapper branches on is kept. Marshal can fail because Details is a json.RawMessage that may hold invalid JSON.
startupfail.Report's stderr headline uses r.info.AppName instead of a hardcoded kira-studio-shell, because Reporter is per-app since P100 Part 1.
In this repo the .githooks/pre-commit hook runs bun run lint and bun run typecheck, and the pre-push lint uses golangci-lint built via scripts/install-golangci-lint.sh.
Part 2 of P108 owns internal/** (all 20 packages), most scripts/*.sh, .githooks, .claude/hooks, root package.json scripts, biome.json, knip.json, .golangci.yml, root tsconfig files and .github/workflows (fixes via docs/pending-changes/); every Go chunk in both apps one-hops into internal/*, so it closes first.

### v1.9 P108 Part 3 Studio persistence, secrets and connection lifecycle
preconnect.Supervisor.Start sets cmd.Stderr to a plain io.Writer feeding the tail tracker (not StderrPipe) and cmd.WaitDelay = killGrace, so Wait() is bounded even if a backgrounded helper outside the process group (setsid, daemon(3)) keeps stderr open.
killEntry's wait after SIGKILL is bounded: it gives up after killGrace and logs, because SIGTERM/SIGKILL to -pid never reaches a process outside the process group.
VariablesRepo.Upsert takes value as *string; nil leaves the stored value untouched, mirroring connections.Input.Password. Needed because a secret's list projection is always "", so renaming an unrevealed secret would otherwise wipe it.
VariablesUpsertArgs.Value is a pointer and returns BadRequest when absent on create.
VariableSetView.vue keeps a per-draft valueTouched flag so only a real edit sends a value to Upsert.
connections validateMode rejects URIs whose password contains an unencoded /, ? or # (uriHasAmbiguousPassword) with a BadRequest asking for percent-encoding, because findAuthority ends the authority at the first such character and the password would be stored unencrypted.
Each connections Connect(id) attempt carries its own cancellable context; Disconnect and Remove cancel it first, and attemptConnect checks ctx.Err() after each racing step and unwinds instead of finalizing connected.
preconnect.Supervisor.Start takes a ctx parameter; cancellation during the 2s settle wait kills the just-spawned process directly, since Stop cannot see entries not yet tracked in s.entries.
destinationUnchanged uses zeroExemptFields to clear all exempt ConnectionFields members on copies of both sides, then reflect.DeepEqual, so any newly added field is gated by default.
redactURLCredentials, once a real :// is found, redacts userinfo unconditionally up to the next @; without one (e.g. jdbc:sqlite:/path) it keeps the conservative check so a coincidental path @ is left alone.
redactQueryCredentials masks any URL query param whose key contains pass, pwd, secret or token, case-insensitively.
keyring_darwin.go's duplicate-item re-query path must apply the same len(Data) == keyBytes check as the main path, otherwise a wrong-length key panics in aes.NewCipher at startup instead of reporting storage unavailable.
keyring_darwin.go is built only with darwin && cgo, so it cannot be built or tested in the Linux sandbox.
MaskRules CopyForConnection lists and inserts rules inside one transaction, calling mintID once per row, to avoid ids/rules count mismatch under concurrent rule changes.
connections Duplicate calls emitListChanged before returning either post-row-insert failure (mask-rule copy or McpEnabled write), since the new connection row is already committed.
capFilterText truncates where_text on a UTF-8 rune boundary (truncateUTF8ToBoundary, mirroring internal/page/scratch.go) and drops an oversized order_by_json to nil rather than truncating, because truncated JSON fails List's decode guard and drops the whole row.
Part 3 of v1.9 P108 owns apps/kira-studio/internal/{storage,secrets,localauth,connections,preconnect,datagrip}; it is pure Go and the bottom of Studio's Go call graph (adapters to storage is 679 edges, mostly model), so it is reviewed before its callers.
In a shared checkout, stage commits by explicit file path and never with git add -A or git add ., because other sessions' uncommitted files would be swept into the commit.
In a shared checkout, scope git stash by pathspec (git stash push -- <paths>), because a full-tree stash captures other sessions' dirty files.
Never bypass .githooks/pre-commit (bun run lint and bun run typecheck) with --no-verify.
bun run lint:go runs golangci-lint, built via scripts/install-golangci-lint.sh, the same way as the pre-push hook.

### v1.9 P108 Part 4 Studio DB adapters I — adapter core and SQL engines
The shared comment/quote scanner (scanQuote) treats backslash as an escape only inside Postgres E'...'/e'...' strings (isEStringOpen, word-boundary-checked); previously a backslash-escaped quote let trailing string content be read as a real -- comment, smuggling a second statement past ClassifySQL and AssertNoTransactionEscalation.
ClassifySQL and classifyClickHouseSQL run the embedded-semicolon guard against the raw statement, never the comment-stripped text, because comment-stripping can be fooled by backslash-quote ambiguity; worst case is a false ClassUnknown, never a false-safe read.
AssertNoTransactionEscalation has a fail-closed backstop (AssertNoHiddenStatement/quoteHasBackslash) that rejects any quoted run containing a raw backslash, because standard_conforming_strings=off makes even plain '...' strings honour backslash escapes and this cannot be detected at parse time.
For read-only Postgres connections, Read and Count run assertReadOnlyFilterSortSafe over the grid filter and text-sort clause.
RunWithAbortRace returns on Stop/cancel before its background goroutine stops touching the connection, so Acquire's release and the detached ROLLBACK/COMMIT cleanup must wait for it; each connEntry (postgres trackedConn, mysqlfamily Entry) has its own inFlight WaitGroup, separate from the adapter-wide tracker Disconnect uses.
Acquire's release Waits on the per-connection inFlight before unlocking the per-connection mutex, and mutate's rollback and console's read-only-wrap COMMIT Wait before issuing cleanup; otherwise cleanup races the still-running goroutine on Postgres's *pgx.Conn or queues behind it on MySQL/MariaDB and blows its 5s deadline.
adapters.ConnSet has a closed flag under its own mu so a dial in flight when CloseAll runs cannot land in the conns map afterward; ConnSet.Current(key) is re-checked after locking entry.mu in Acquire, retrying on mismatch, to handle LRU eviction closing an entry between Get and Lock.
The relational, clickhouse and sqlite adapters guard their connection handle fields (connSet/cfg/primaryDatabase/readOnly; clickhouse handle; sqlite db/file/readOnly) with locked get/set/clear accessors, because Connect/Disconnect previously wrote them unlocked against in-flight ops.
QueryTracker.TrackerFor does inFlight.Add(1) under the same lock that checks/sets a draining flag, to avoid WaitGroup misuse against a concurrent Drain.
Disconnect in postgres, mysqlfamily and clickhouse takes a QueryTracker.Snapshot() of tracked opIDs and cancels each server-side before calling the ctx-bounded Drain(ctx), so Disconnect no longer blocks for the longest running query; Drain's background goroutine keeps running so the tracker still clears. Sqlite mirrors this with local sqlite3_interrupt via ctx.
ClickHouse's http.Client has no overall Timeout (a 60s one failed long queries client-side without sending KILL QUERY); connection setup is bounded by http.Transport DialContext and TLSHandshakeTimeout (10s each), and cancellation is ctx-driven plus KILL QUERY on cancel.
adapterhost's reconnect ordering (Router.Connect's existing.Disconnect outside RunOp, Router.Disconnect serialization against other ops) is out of scope for Part 4 and deferred to Part 6, which reviews that package.
Postgres buildConfig sets connConfig.Fallbacks = nil whenever it overrides Host/Port or TLSConfig, because environment-derived (PG*) fallbacks would let pgconn silently connect to another host or downgrade to plaintext regardless of the user's explicit sslmode.
In MySQL/MariaDB, BIT columns are classified as binaryType (not numberType) in typeClassFor, so BinaryColumnsOf recognizes them and NewParamRenderer decodes the 0x<hex> display text back to raw bytes on edit.
SQLite PRIMARY KEY does not imply NOT NULL (composite or non-INTEGER single-column PK on a rowid table can hold NULL), so getReadTarget checks the PK with pkIsKeysetEligible and falls back to a unique key or rowid; WITHOUT ROWID PKs and a single-column INTEGER PRIMARY KEY (rowid alias) are exempt because table_xinfo's notnull flag misreports them.
SQLite catalog queries must be schema-qualified because default resolution lets an ATTACHed/TEMP table shadow a main-schema one: pragmas table_xinfo/index_list/index_info/foreign_key_list take schema as second argument and sqlite_master is schema-quoted.
pragma_table_list takes only a single table-name argument with no schema-scoping form, so getReadTarget filters on its schema output column via WHERE.
WhereClause puts the closing paren of the filter on its own line, so a filter ending in a -- line comment cannot comment out the paren or keyset text appended after it.
Sort direction must be exactly lowercase asc or desc: ComputeEffectiveOrder (via validateRequestedTerms) and ClickHouse computeOrderBySql reject anything else with CodeQuery, because BuildKeysetPredicate compares the lowercase literal while BuildOrderBy uppercases, so an upper-case direction would silently mispage.
rejectDSNMetacharacters rejects ?, # and % in a SQLite DSN path, because SQLite URI parsing percent-decodes the path and could open a different file than the one assertFileExists confirmed.
scripts/demo-dbs/docker-compose.yml binds every demo database port mapping to 127.0.0.1, since the demo databases use trivial passwords.
Keyset boundary arithmetic is covered by table-driven unit tests, which is CLAUDE.md's test-bar exception.
In a shared checkout with concurrent sessions, verify each commit with git log and git show --stat against the intended file list right after committing, because another session's concurrent commit can sweep in or block your changes.
Confirm regression tests for parser-with-interacting-rules and keyset-boundary-arithmetic logic fail against the pre-fix code before landing, per CLAUDE.md's test bar.

### v1.9 P108 Part 5 Studio DB adapters II — document, key-value, stream and object-store engines
v1.9 P108 Part 5 owns apps/kira-studio/internal/adapters/{mongo,redis,kafka,sqs,s3,awscfg}/**, is pure Go, and runs after Part 4 so the shared adapter core is settled first.
Part 5 was split from Part 4 on size (about 38k lines together).
The Redis console must deny connection-state commands (SELECT, MULTI/EXEC/DISCARD/WATCH/UNWATCH, SUBSCRIBE and siblings, MONITOR, HELLO/AUTH/RESET, QUIT, CLIENT REPLY OFF|SKIP) before they reach conn.Do, because the shared pooled client does not track state raw commands change.
Redis rejectConnectionStateCommand matches CLIENT REPLY as its own two-token command so ordinary CLIENT subcommands (GETNAME/INFO/LIST) stay usable, and points SELECT at the app's own database selector.
Kafka advanceWindows only clamps a partition to Next = End if the round was not page-capped, the partition's watermark reached End, and this round delivered or skipped zero records for that partition, because franz-go caps each partition's fetch at 1 MiB per round (maxPartBytes in config.go) independent of the page budget.
Kafka true exhaustion of a partition falls back to the exhaustedByEmptyPolls latch.
In all five adapters (Mongo, Redis, Kafka, SQS, S3), handle fields written by Connect/Disconnect are guarded by locked get/set/clear accessors, because ops run on whatever goroutine adapterhost dispatches them on.
SQS cacheQueueURL is a no-op once Disconnect has nilled the map, to avoid a nil-map write panic from an op that passed requireClient before a concurrent Disconnect.
Mongo tracks in-flight queries with adapters.QueryTracker[uint64], registered at each RunWithAbortRace call site via a TrackQuery hook; a package-level queryTokenSeq disambiguates overlapping registrations under the same opID.
Mongo Disconnect snapshots and cancels/killOps every tracked opID, then Drains bounded by ctx, then gives client.Disconnect its own deadline (disconnectTimeout) so in-use connections are force-closed regardless of the ctx passed.
Router.Connect's reconnect path passes context.Background() unbounded to Disconnect; this is adapterhost's file (Part 6), left as an explicit hand-off to Part 6, with Mongo's disconnectTimeout containing the exposure.
S3 applyPreservedAttributes copies ServerSideEncryption, SSEKMSKeyId, BucketKeyEnabled, Expires, WebsiteRedirectLocation and the three object-lock fields on edit, because otherwise an SSE-KMS object was silently re-encrypted under the bucket default.
S3 applyUpdate refuses an edit when head.TagCount > 0 rather than doing a tagging round trip, so it never silently drops tags.
S3 applyUpdate sends IfMatch with head.ETag and applyInsert sends IfNoneMatch "*"; both fall back (logged) to unconditional behavior for S3-compatible endpoints that reject the conditional header with NotImplemented.
Mongo keysetIDCondition widens the _id boundary with an $or across every BSON type sorting on the correct side (bsonSortTiers, numeric aliases collapsed into one tier), because $gt/$lt only match the boundary's own BSON type and collections can mix _id types (applyInsert mints an ObjectId when _id is omitted).
Mongo buildReadPage uses id="" for documents lacking _id (e.g. a $project {_id:0} view) and forces offset pagination with no keyset tokens when any document in the result lacks _id.
Mongo console parseStatement runs ResolveEJSONWrappers on parsed arguments before the isWriteStatement check, so {$oid}/{$date}/{$numberLong} wrappers copied from the grid work; aggregate's $out/$merge pipeline-stage detection is unaffected since resolving a stage bson.D preserves its type.
AWS requires MessageGroupId on every .fifo queue and MessageDeduplicationId unless content-based dedup is enabled; SQS SendMessage previously set neither, while caps.CanInsert reports true for all queues including FIFO.
SQS FIFO inserts: resolveFIFOInsertFields derives MessageGroupId and MessageDeduplicationId from $messageGroupId/$messageDeduplicationId sentinel fields on the insert body for a .fifo queue name.
For SQS FIFO queues, ContentBasedDeduplication is checked via GetQueueAttributes only when a dedup id is missing, and a clear E_QUERY naming what is required is returned.
SQS receiptHandles records receivedAt and the queue's visibility timeout (default 30s when unreadable) with each handle, and forDelete refuses a delete past that window (exactly time.Since == visibilityTimeout counts as expired), because AWS may accept a stale handle without deleting and the adapter would falsely report AffectedRows:1.
Mongo and Redis console execute parse/tokenize and read-only-check every statement up front before executing any, because a typo later in a batch previously left earlier writes committed with no rollback and re-running double-applied them.
Redis console scanQuotedToken implements redis-cli sdssplitargs escaping: \n, \r, \t, \b, \a and \xHH inside double quotes; only \' special inside single quotes; a closing quote followed by a non-space character is rejected.
The Redis tokenizer is split into scanQuotedToken/scanBareToken to keep gocognit under its limit.
Mongo fields-mode buildURIFromFields builds userinfo via url.UserPassword/url.User, not url.QueryEscape, because the driver decodes with url.PathUnescape and the two diverge on spaces, breaking auth for passwords containing a space.
Mongo buildURIFromFields and Redis dial use net.JoinHostPort for host:port, because a bare %s:%d is invalid for an IPv6 literal; this matches Kafka's adapter.
Docker-backed conformance suites (SA/*/*_test.go real-container tests) require Docker.

### v1.9 P108 Part 6 Studio engine data plane and page wire protocol
Router.Connect's reconnect branch and Router.Disconnect previously ran the old adapter's Disconnect outside RunOp, unbounded under context.Background(), so a dead-network TCP retransmit timeout or an in-flight op holding CloseAll's entry mutex could hang them for minutes.
Host.CancelOpsForConnection locally cancels every other running op for a connection id before the old adapter is disconnected; the old adapter's Disconnect now runs inside RunOp (kind "disconnect"), bounded to the caller's ctx plus a fixed 10s (disconnectTimeout), at every call site.
QueryTracker.Drain and ConnSet.CloseAll have no time bound of their own.
Because every op on the old adapter is locally cancelled before a reconnect or disconnect replaces or removes it, CancelOp no longer sends Cancel to a replacement adapter; a later redundant CancelOp for a cancelled opID is a harmless no-op.
adapters.DeleteLiveAdapterIf is a real compare-and-delete; Router.takeLiveAdapterForTeardown wraps it, serialized per connection id by Router.teardown (a keyedMutex), and removes the registry entry before the slow Disconnect, so a racing reconnect and Disconnect cannot both tear down the same adapter and a concurrent reconnect's newer adapter is never deleted.
Router.SchemaColumns and KeyTypes pass "schemaColumns" and "keyTypes" to RunOp, so both were added to model.opKinds (Go), opKindSchema (packages/shared/domain/ops.ts) and throttledKinds; oplog.handleOpStart rejects unrecognized kinds, which previously produced phantom "test"-kind op:end records.
tests/unit/go-ts-vocabulary-parity.spec.ts asserts that the Go and TS op-kind lists match, guarding against drift.
enginecache uses a generationTracker (enginecache/generation.go) with a monotonic generation per (connectionID, path) target, per connection, and global, guarded by Cache's mutex; Dispatcher.Read/Count capture Cache.CurrentGeneration before issuing the op and use StorePageIfCurrent/StoreCountIfCurrent so a result racing an invalidation is not cached.
The enginecache generation is bumped by DropTarget, DropPagesOnly, InvalidateAfterMutation (pages drop and counts stale-mark), DropConnection and Clear; StorePage/StoreCount remain plain unconditional stores for callers with no race.
Host's eventSub queues events unboundedly; a single drain goroutine is the only sender on and closer of the consumer channel, and on unsubscribe it delivers all queued events before closing, so no accepted event is lost. This replaced a fixed 32-slot non-blocking buffer that silently dropped events.
oplog is the only production Host.Subscribe consumer (via main.go's oplog.New(router.Host(), ...)), and it does a synchronous SQLite write plus a Wails emit per event; a dropped op:end leaves an op_log row stuck "running" forever.
A session's in-flight op cap is 64 concurrent ops (session.go).
In port.ts, onmessage wraps the whole decode call in try/catch and drops any frame it cannot decode, with no id to reject a specific pending call with.
decodeFrame wraps only the ok:true payload decode in its own try/catch and, on failure, returns an ordinary {ok:false} response using the already-extracted id, so handleMessage rejects that pending call instead of leaving it hanging.
A structurally corrupt frame (bad "KIF1" identifier, missing envelope field) still throws from decodeFrame and is dropped by port.ts, because there is no id to recover.
A data op has no client-side timeout of its own (timeoutMs: null), so cancellation is the only escape hatch; a res frame whose payload failed to decode previously left its pending call hanging forever.
Children/Describe/Definition/SchemaColumns capture the connection's Since via sinceEpoch before each backend call, and putIfSinceUnchanged stores the result in metadata_cache only if Since is unchanged, skipping the write (not the response) otherwise.
An unconditional Put stamped fetchedAt after the new freshness floor set by a reconnect (freshnessFloor reads the connection Since), so a listing fetched against the old target was wrongly treated as fresh.
Go's truncateUTF8ToBoundary must mirror page.ts's truncateUtf8ToBoundary: back off only while the byte at the cut boundary is a continuation byte (utf8.RuneStart check), capped at 3 bytes (utf8.UTFMax-1). The earlier utf8.DecodeLastRune version walked back through runs of Latin-1 0xE0-0xFF bytes without bound, clipping far below the 64 KiB page-scratch limit.
The ipcfixture harness tracks connections made via Recorder.ConnectionsConnect (App.trackConnected) and disconnects them automatically via disconnectTracked in a cleanup registered last so it runs first (t.Cleanup is LIFO), tearing down live adapters before connectionsSvc.Shutdown and before the DB/repos close.
Previously the clickhouse/kafka/mariadb/mysql/redis/sqs tests never disconnected, so real adapters accumulated in the process-global registry (adapters.live) across test runs.
The e2e real-build lock file (.e2e-real-build.lock) carries its owner's pid; isLockStale reclaims it when older than 10 minutes or when the pid is no longer a live process (zero-signal process.kill probe), and acquireBuildLock fails loudly after 15 minutes instead of looping forever.
.e2e-real-build.lock is gitignored.
After each commit in a shared checkout, diff git show --stat HEAD against the intended file list, because concurrent sessions' commits can sweep in your staged files.
F9's regression tests drive the ipcfixture harness's cleanup mechanism directly rather than through a real Docker-gated connect, so they run without a Docker daemon.
The Docker-backed conformance suites (ipcfixture's six *_test.go files and e2e-real) need a reachable Docker daemon to run.

### v1.9 P108 Part 7 Studio Go app shell, Wails bridge and agent integrations
queryplan.StatementsFor composes ClickHouse statements starting with EXPLAIN PLAN or EXPLAIN ESTIMATE, so classifyClickHouseSQL must skip the optional EXPLAIN kind keyword (AST/SYNTAX/QUERY TREE/PLAN/PIPELINE/ESTIMATE/TABLE OVERRIDE) and its optional 'k = v, …' settings list before classifying the real target.
Without stripping the EXPLAIN kind keyword, ClickHouse SQL was classified 'unknown', so every ClickHouse explain_query errored and run_query's auto-explain heavy-query gate never fired.
ClickHouse classifier tests are built from queryplan.StatementsFor("clickhouse", …) so the composer and classifier stay in lockstep.
On a connection with an active mask set, explain_query masks plan output via maskPlanForMaskedConnection/maskPlanNode: it recursively blanks Detail, drops metrics whose name ends with ' condition', and blanks Raw, because MySQL/MariaDB attached_condition exposes real const-folded values.
explain_query's prompt-approval path re-resolves resolveEnabled and the read verdict after ApprovalApproved before executing, mirroring run_query's awaitApproval, because read-mode or MCP exposure can change during the up-to-2-minute approval dialog.
All six MCP tool handlers are wrapped by a generic withPanicRecovery[In any] around every mcp.AddTool call, because go-sdk v1.8.0 has no recover() and a handler panic would crash the desktop app; it logs the stack and returns a generic 'internal error' IsError result.
Never return panic text to MCP clients, because on a masked connection it could carry row data.
The DB MCP Command/Install UI is gated on the on-disk helper file existing and matching the current token record (TokenRecord/LoadHelperToken/helperTokenMatchesRecord/helperTokenValid), not on the in-memory minted flag, so it survives restarts within the token's 7-day TTL.
A missing or mismatched helper token file makes the server write the record and helper together (reminting) rather than serve a record no client can match; SetToken no longer takes a plaintext.
In DatabaseMcpPane.vue, Regenerate renders whenever the MCP server is running, regardless of whether a command is shown, so an expired token always has a remedy in the UI.
The Claude Code headersHelper path must be single-quoted (shellSingleQuote) in both the add-json payload and the displayed Command, because Claude Code runs it through a shell and a path with a space silently sends no Authorization header, so every call 401s.
Install refuses outright when the helper path is not absolute, because an os.UserHomeDir failure could yield a relative path resolved against Claude Code's cwd instead of Kira's.
If the DB MCP server cannot bind DefaultPort (8766), bindHTTP returns the bind error instead of falling back to an ephemeral port; the error surfaces via DbMcpStatus.Error and the boot-time warn log.
Ephemeral-port fallback was rejected because existing registrations would point at 8766 while the live server and its bearer token sat on a different port that any local uid could have bound first.
keepawake's caffeinate driver reap reports a lost assertion (onLost) only if its own cmd is still current (d.cmd == cmd), so Release followed immediately by Acquire (Rearm) does not turn an intentional kill into a false onLost.
TestCaffeinateDriverReapIgnoresSupersededChild deterministically forces the Rearm race by holding d.mu across the kill-then-replace window, because the probabilistic timing did not reproduce.
main.go teardown stops DB MCP and agenthooks before connectionsSvc.Shutdown(), each blocking on its own in-flight handlers, so a mid-quit run_query cannot dial a preconnect target already being torn down.
The connections Service has a closed flag; Shutdown refuses new Connects, cancels all in-flight attempts, waits for each to unwind, then calls Preconnect.StopAll, because StopAll only kills tracked entries and an attempt inside Preconnect.Start's 2s settle window would otherwise orphan its Setpgid sidecar (e.g. ssh tunnel).
CLAUDE.md has a rule that known-open ARCHITECTURE.md items are deleted once resolved.
ARCHITECTURE.md documents a known-open item that DB MCP over-refuses JSON/array columns.
The repo's .githooks/pre-commit runs biome, check-tokens.sh and the full parallel typecheck:* split.

### v1.9 P108 Part 8 Studio API client backend
httpclient compares each redirect hop against the origin and strips secret headers on either a host change or an https-to-http same-host scheme downgrade.
gRPC Describe resolution is bound by a default timeout, so a hung reflection server cannot hang the call forever.
The reflection linker is guarded against cyclic proto dependencies, which previously crashed the whole app.
An undecryptable or NULL environment secret shadows as unresolved instead of falling through to a different scope's secret of the same name.
A plain (non-secret) value containing literal {{secretName}} text is reported as deferred by stage 2 rather than expanded as a secret reference.
Postman import applies the object-form {{$alias}} rewrite before the 'unchanged from origin' comparison, as export does, so untouched requests with alias references keep their verbatim origin.
Postman import strips plaintext auth blocks and secret-typed folder/item variables from origin_json, matching export-time blanking (D16), so the origin copy cannot re-export secrets verbatim.
curl import of -u user:pass uses a UTF-8-correct btoa helper and keeps a credential containing a {{var}} reference unencoded with a warning, because bare btoa throws on non-Latin1 and destroys {{ }} references.
curl import treats --json as --data-binary plus two headers, routing @file arguments through the same file-reference path as -d/--data-binary.
The gRPC descriptor cache uses a generation counter (Put checked against the generation at resolve start, bumped on invalidate) and singleflight so stale Puts cannot resurrect invalidated entries and concurrent identical resolutions share one reflection RPC.
In httpclient the wire pane's secret masking runs before the D4 truncation cap, via a *strings.Replacer passed through Options/renderRequest/renderFormDataBody; an opaque stdlib type keeps httpclient from importing apivars.
sanitizeUnmarshalError keeps only the line:column position for protojson syntax errors so substituted secrets are not echoed to the renderer; semantic errors such as unknown field pass through untouched.
Go forgivingBase64Decode matches the WHATWG forgiving-base64 algorithm (as TS atob): it strips up to 2 trailing '=' only when length is a multiple of 4, rejects leftover '=', and decodes unpadded, so "YQ=" is rejected in both stages.
The history per-scope trim is 30, and the secret replacer masks both Wire.Request and Wire.ResponseHead.
Response bodies, gRPC response messages and jar cookies reach kira.sqlite history unmasked, accepted by design (P8 OQ-6, P11) and listed in ARCHITECTURE.md's Known open items.
The Go/TS parity extractors strip // comments before scanning, close a map body with a string-aware depth count, and assert the extracted set/map is non-empty.
writeFileAtomically resolves the destination via filepath.EvalSymlinks, writes through symlinks, mirrors an existing target's mode (0600 default for fresh export), and re-asserts it with Chmod because OpenFile's perm is subject to umask.
If ImportVariables fails after ImportTree committed, the returned error names both failures (including a failed compensating Delete) and states the collection remains and needs manual removal.
Commit with an explicit -- <pathspec> on every git commit (not just git add) in a shared non-worktree checkout, because the slow full-monorepo pre-commit hook creates a race window where another session's staged changes get absorbed into the commit.
.githooks/pre-commit runs biome plus a full monorepo typecheck, and its run time is long enough to create a race window between concurrent sessions sharing one checkout.
Regression tests exist for stale-generation/singleflight, mask-before-cap/rune-boundary, syntax-error-token stripping, base64 truth table, and mode preservation/symlinks; roundtrip_test.go fixture/assertions were extended.
Per CLAUDE.md, doc and error-message fixes get no dedicated test; dedicated tests are required only for complex or hard-to-get-right logic.
Never bypass the pre-commit hook with --no-verify.

### v1.9 P108 Part 9 Studio API client UI
The history store's load must separate 'superseded by a newer load' (discard, no retry) from 'marked stale during this load' (retry only if no newer load exists), because concurrent loads each bumping latestSeq superseded each other and retried forever with loading stuck true.
ensureVariablesLoaded uses a per-key in-flight promise map plus a per-key generation counter, and a load only commits if its generation is still current, so a slow concurrent call cannot overwrite fresher loadVariableSetRows data with stale rows.
syncDrafts seeds a secret row's draft from revealedValues when present, because reloading rows otherwise blanked a revealed secret's draft to '' while revealedValues stayed set, so re-revealing never fired the mirror watch.
Request and gRPC views call ensureSavedRequestLoaded/ensureSavedGrpcRequestLoaded on mount and on itemId change, with an orphan vs not-loaded-yet distinction gating Save, because restored tabs otherwise never loaded their saved side, so the dirty dot never lit and Save created a duplicate row.
Request views call initCollections() on mount, because collectionIdFor read '' until CollectionsPanel mounted, silently dropping collection-scoped plain values and secrets from resolution.
The Cookies pane and its badge use the same stage-1-resolved URL that send uses, with a note when the host still carries a deferred secret, because the unresolved tab.state.url showed zero cookies for templated hosts like {{baseUrl}}/login.
The cookies store uses a per-tab request sequence (only the latest reply is written), clears the debounce timer on tab cleanup, and refetches every open tab after clearCookies, fixing out-of-order replies, timers recreating a closed tab's runtime, and single-tab refetch.
HTTP tab cleanup calls stopOp first, and send's post-await path and noteRecorded return early once the tab is gone, because closing a tab mid-send otherwise leaked the op and kept recording history, recreating the runtime.
Deleting an environment drops matching incognitoEnvByTab overrides and evicts listCache[environment:<id>]; deleting a collection evicts listCache[collection:<id>], so incognito tabs do not keep substituting a deleted environment's stale values.
useCollectionsStore and useVariablesStore expose state.error and dismissError (the variable-set half reuses variableSetError), every mutation is wrapped, and importCollection reloads the tree in finally so a partial import is visible, because bridge errors previously vanished.
Postman export's exportWarning includes both the secret-count and skipped-gRPC-count notes, because ExportReport.skippedGrpc was ignored and gRPC requests were silently omitted.
F12 (no cross-window invalidation; hand-rolled server-state caches) was deferred to follow-up phase P112: listCache, environment list/active environment, and collections tree/saved-request caches would move onto TanStack Query, invalidated by a new Go-broadcast api-data-changed event.
openHistoryMenu captures variableId and writes only if it still matches, and tab cleanup resets historyMenuState, preventing one row's entries showing in another row's popover.
The gRPC call() function itself errors clearly when findMethod hasn't resolved, instead of defaulting streaming to false, because the button disable is bypassed by Enter and the command palette; the view's methodResolved computed disables the Call button as a secondary UX fix.
The shared shadcn Alert in packages/theme has first-class warn and note variants, mirroring the destructive variant's *:data-[slot=alert-description]: targeting, replacing duplicated .strip-warn/.strip-note CSS, per CLAUDE.md's Tailwind rule.
Save-dialog UI state (open/tabId/suggestedName/payload, openSaveDialog/openSaveGrpcDialog/closeSaveDialog) lives in useSaveRequestDialogStore, per CLAUDE.md's one-store-one-concern rule; submitSaveDialog stays in useCollectionsStore and closes through the new store.
The gRPC history view carries each stored message's truncated flag (messages over the 64 KiB per-message cap, applied only to what History stores) and shows a warning-icon tooltip on truncated message headers; live messages map in as false.
The gRPC history pane shows requestMessageTruncated as a note next to the 'viewing a history call' band, because the pane does not render the stored request message body.
P108 Part 9 owns apps/kira-studio/frontend/src/api/**, views/httprequest/**, views/grpcrequest/** and related unit/UI tests; it is Stream A position 8 and its backend (Part 8) is settled first.
The repo's .githooks/pre-commit runs biome, check-tokens.sh and the full parallel typecheck:* split.
Per CLAUDE.md's pre-existing-failure rule, pre-existing lint warnings in files a phase never touched are out of scope for that phase.
CLAUDE.md has a CRUD-round-trip exclusion bar: repetitive try/catch error-surfacing patterns across many call sites get no dedicated regression test (applied to F10).
Commit with an explicit pathspec (git commit -- <pathspec>) in a shared, non-worktree checkout, because concurrent fixers work in the same checkout on disjoint files and a bare commit could pick up their changes.
Never use --no-verify on commits in this repo; the pre-commit hook must run.

### v1.9 P108 Part 10 Studio grid and shared view machinery
In Studio grid navigation, goNext and goPrev return immediately if a load is in flight (rt.opId !== null), before any optimistic pageIndex patch, because a second call reused the same token and could double-advance pageIndex or revert to the wrong previous index.
fake-data's datatype.boolean generator emits '1'/'0' for MySQL and SQLite and true/false for Postgres and ClickHouse, because text 'true'/'false' fails MySQL strict-mode TINYINT bind and lands as text in SQLite's NUMERIC-affinity BOOLEAN column.
ejson.ts gates its $numberLong branch on Number.isSafeInteger rather than Number.isFinite, so values beyond Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER stay wrapped instead of being re-encoded as a rounded plain number.
Never put aria-hidden="true" on FkPreviewPopover.vue's backdrop, because it is the popover's own interactive backdrop and the attribute hides it from assistive tech.
quoteIdent for ClickHouse escapes a literal backslash as a double backslash before doubling backticks, and strips embedded NUL bytes via name.split('\u0000').join('') because a regex literal containing \u0000 trips biome's noControlCharactersInRegex rule.
reloadAfterMutation steps back one page and reloads again when the reloaded page has rowCount === 0 and pageIndex > 0 (e.g. the last row of the last page was deleted).
CountRuntime has a countError (string | null) field, set by runPagedCount's catch path via classifyLoadError and implemented by the grid, documents, keyvalue and stream runtimes. DataToolbar.vue shows it in error-red with a tooltip, ahead of the stale-amber state, so a failed count refresh is distinguishable from count not yet requested.
createImmediateMutator isolates each post-write step (opts.reload, reloadTabsForTarget, after) in its own try/catch and throws one combined 'saved, but refresh failed: ...' error only if any failed, so a successful write is not reported as a failure.
parseTimestamp's epoch branches accept only strictly formatted decimals matching /^-?\d+(?:\.(\d+))?$/, rejecting hex, exponent and blank text. encodeTimestamp's epochSeconds branch reuses the original fraction text when the value is unchanged, so re-encoding is exact.
fractionDigits and fractionRaw apply to both the iso8601 and epochSeconds timestamp formats.
eachMatch takes an optional maxLength that truncates scanned cell text, with REGEX_SCAN_TEXT_CAP = 10_000, to bound ReDoS exposure from user-authored regexes. It is applied via regexTextCap only in grid/search.ts and shared/keyvalue/search.ts when q.regex is true, not in console/search.ts or documents/search.ts.
When the edit buffer is dirty and the previous cell is still editable, the selectedCell watch stages the edit via prevCell.onEdit(doc.value) before reseeding for the new cell, following the file's 'stage on leave' rule, so unsaved edits are not discarded.
PreviewCommandPanel.vue's preview-SQL query uses gcTime: 0, because DataView.vue mounts the panel with v-if="previewOpen" (full unmount on close) and the query key has no pending-set version, so a stale cached entry would show on reopen.
finance.amount allows wholeDigits = 0 and then uses max = 1 - 10 ** -dec, so a numeric(p,p) column such as numeric(2,2) (max 0.99) does not overflow.
stream/state.ts is not a caller of runPagedLoad (only documents, grid and keyvalue are), although its hand-written load() has the same shape. It is an unadopted candidate left to Part 11, which owns that file.
@tanstack/vue-virtual is still used in this app: views/shared/keyvalue/KeyValuePane.vue and views/grpcrequest/ResponsePane.vue import useVirtualizer from it. Only the grid no longer uses it, since SlickGrid virtualizes there.
Navigation that discards pending changes without a confirm (pager, sort, filter, projection, refresh) is intended per decision D3; only background and failed loads are covered by findings F1 and F2.
The grid's edit actions (canEditTable, canDeleteRows in SlickGridHost.vue and DataToolbar isWritable) all include !maskPreview, and toggling preview is refused while pending changes exist.
Go's AssertKeyIsPrimaryKey (sqlmutate.go) rejects any mutation key that is not exactly the primary key, so a partial PK from a projection hiding PK columns cannot cause a wrong write; the affected-exactly-one assertion also rejects keys matching zero rows.
primaryKeyOf reads the committed page value via cell(), not the staged value, when edits touch a PK column.
The inline editor skips unchanged values, but paste can stage a same-value UPDATE; this is intended because paste is an explicit write.
Mutate is one transaction per adapter contract, and commitPending clears pending changes only on success; DataView.onCommit shows the error on failure.
applyLoadFailure with a stale opId returns before touching status, since a superseding op owns the status, so status cannot get stuck at loading.
Range paste spilling into insert rows past the filtered rows is intended behavior per the pasteTargetRows doc.
useConnectionGate.onReconnectAndLoad marks hydrated after a connect that lands in an error state, but needsReconnect also checks connectionStatus !== 'connected' so the gate stays up, and the failed load makes applyLoadFailure unmark hydrated (self-correcting).
ejsonToPlain loses precision for Long/Decimal values; this is a documented accepted tradeoff (ejson.ts).
rowsToInsert writes a truncated column as NULL with a leading comment naming the column.
Tables and views cannot expose duplicate column names in any supported engine (SQLite renames view duplicates), so the data grid never sees duplicates and pageColumnIndexFor's last-wins behavior is safe there.
Tab-close cleanup is registered via registerTabRuntimeCleanup for grid runtime, keyvalue runtime, the ::preview page, document rows, search and visible-rows state; pending changes clear in state/tabs.ts.
The TanStack Query client is configured app-wide with retry: false and no refetch on window focus (packages/workbench/src/state/queryClient.ts).
Every :disabled button in views/grid and views/shared sits inside TooltipDisabledTrigger.
AutocompleteField.vue escapePlain escapes & < > for text content; double quotes matter only in attributes, which paintOverlayHtml builds from static class names.
validate.ts accepts an empty value for every format; an empty string on a NOT NULL numeric column fails server-side with the engine's message.
The F7 fix required rewriting view-state.spec.ts test 9, which had encoded the race being fixed as correct behavior; F9, F15 and F16 each added a dedicated regression test.
The repo's .githooks/pre-commit runs biome, check-tokens.sh and the full parallel typecheck:* split.
Write dedicated tests for hard-to-get-right logic, and fix a pre-existing test that encodes a bug on the spot, per CLAUDE.md.

### v1.9 P108 Part 11 Studio query console, SQL editor and per-kind data views
Part 11 (plan §5.10, Stream A position 10) owns the Studio query console, SQL editor and per-kind data views under apps/kira-studio/frontend/src (views/console, editor, documents, keyvalue, stream, browse, definition), plus beautify.ts, the SQL shared/domain files and tests/fixtures.
The console and the per-kind views both sit on views/shared (Part 10) and share result rendering, so they are one chunk.
Closing a console tab cancels the in-flight run and auto-explain, because run()/explain() otherwise kept a reference to the detached runtime object, never saw supersession, and the statement kept running on an unseen connection.
isExplainable in console/explain.ts rejects a SELECT/WITH statement containing an embedded ; before the trailing one, so a merged multi-statement blob is not sent through EXPLAIN as one statement; guarded on both the TS and Go sides.
Run statement treats the span after a ; or on a blank line before the next statement's first non-space character as belonging to the preceding statement. It is implemented by statementAtOffset in packages/shared/domain/sql-split.ts, used by statementAtCursor and ConsoleView.vue's caret lookup.
scanSqlSpan (sql-lex.ts) is dialect-aware through SqlLexOptions: hashComments, slashSlashComments, nestedBlockComments, bracketIdentifiers and postgresEscapeStrings. These cover MySQL/ClickHouse # comments, Postgres E'' strings and nested block comments, and [bracket] identifiers. A $ inside a Postgres identifier is not read as a dollar-quote tag. sqlIdent.ts's dialect-keyed builders build the options.
Operation history records the originating tab's path in OpRecord.Path (migration 0027_p108part11_op_log_path.sql). Re-run reopens at that path, refuses when it is missing, and reconnects via ensureConnectedForRun. Otherwise unqualified DML could hit a same-named table in a different database or schema.
All adapters (postgres, sqlite, mysqlfamily, mongo, clickhouse) join console statements with the shared adapters.JoinConsoleStatements instead of a bare strings.Join(statements, ";\n"), mirroring the TS joinFormattedStatements, so a trailing line comment does not swallow the separator.
ProjectionMenu.vue does not infer 'everything' from selected.size === fieldNames.length on unmount, because fieldNames is the already-projected page's field set and an untouched close cleared an active projection. The shared helpers setsEqual and nextDocumentProjectionOnClose in projection.ts decide this.
Console row/range copy disambiguates duplicate column names (e.g. self-join) via disambiguateNames in clipboardFormats.ts, so TSV/CSV/JSON output does not overwrite same-named columns. It is scoped to console; grid's name-keyed column widths are excluded.
Escape database-sourced text in Monaco hover content: plain-text lines go through escapeMarkdownSyntaxTokens (VS Code's convention), and the single value entry goes through fenceMarkdownValue, a CommonMark fence one backtick longer than the longest backtick run in the value.
formatConsoleText's joinFormattedStatements appends an extra newline before the ;\n separator when a statement's last line contains a -- or # comment, so the separator is not absorbed into the comment. formatMongoStatement refuses trailing content with 'unexpected trailing content after statement', matching the Go adapter.
The shared KuiColumnResizeHandle in packages/kira-ui emits cancel when a drag is cancelled (Escape or lost pointer capture) and only responds to the left button, so StreamView resets liveResizeWidth. CommitGrid.vue ignores cancel because it holds no live-resize preview state.
Console Run, Run all and Explain are guarded by a starting ref, checked alongside running and used in the disabled bindings. It covers the await of ensureConnectedForRun() so a second click during a slow reconnect cannot start an overlapping run.
Regex-search text is capped per cell/body/document by REGEX_SCAN_TEXT_CAP in console search, documents search, the editor find bar (findRanges.ts), and grid/keyvalue search, to avoid pathological regexes like (a+)+$ blocking the main thread.
onFormat() discards the formatted result and shows a note if the tab's live text changed during the await of formatConsoleText (a dynamic import of sql-formatter on first use), instead of overwriting a keystroke typed meanwhile.
stream/state.ts load() uses the shared runPagedLoad from shared/page/load.ts, like documents, grid and keyvalue, for the supersede, tab-closed, page-kind-check and applyLoadFailure handling.
applyStreamFilter clears rt.countError along with rt.count and rt.countOpId, and the stream and document toolbars' count buttons tint and show the count failure in their tooltip, as grid/DataToolbar.vue does. runPagedCount sets countError on failure for all four views.
Wrap toolbar buttons with a dynamic :disabled in TooltipDisabledTrigger, because a disabled native button dispatches no pointer or focus events and its tooltip never fires.
Console, Stream and Document Refresh/Stop buttons are wrapped in TooltipDisabledTrigger. Browse's and Definition's Stop buttons, permanently disabled with nothing to cancel, were removed.
The document context menu's Delete item is gated by a deleteGate parameter of rowMenu(), the same way editGate gates Edit. DocumentView.vue passes { deletable: canDelete.value, label: deleteTitle.value }, the same values the row's Delete button uses (caps.canDelete combined with the connection's readOnly flag), so it does not offer a Delete that fails server-side.
In a shared checkout, commit with an explicit pathspec (git commit -m msg -- <paths>), because a plain commit sweeps in files another concurrent session has staged; a pathspec commit builds its tree only from the named paths.
The container's preinstalled golangci-lint binary refuses this repo's go 1.27.1, so golangci-lint must be installed via scripts/install-golangci-lint.sh as described in docs/DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md.
Pre-existing failure: bridge-unwrap.spec.ts (1 test) fails because bridge/control.ts does not meet its wrap contract (every promise-returning method should surface { code: 'E_QUERY' }, not a raw rejection); it is unrelated to console/editor.
Per CLAUDE.md, a pre-existing failure may be left unfixed when fixing it needs work genuinely outside the phase's scope, such as a different subsystem or a real design decision.

### v1.9 P108 Part 12 Studio shell, project tree, state stores and UI-test harness
In Kira Studio, applyRemote writes the pushed DDL from a remote onSchemaChanged event straight into the query cache instead of only calling invalidateQueries, because the refetch always hit schemaQueryOptions' prefer-cached-value guard and never moved the cache.
Schema in-flight-save race protection uses a per-connection write generation bumped on every direct cache write (saveDdl and applyRemote, via a shared commitDdl helper), rather than always preferring the cache.
The DB MCP approval dialog is keyed by requestId and its onApprove/onDeny are bound to the id rendered in the template, so a queue swap mid-click cannot land the click on a different request; focus moves to Deny whenever requestId changes.
approveQuery/denyQuery rely solely on the approval broker's own broadcast, not the RPC's returned snapshot, because the snapshot could race a second window's concurrent answer.
initTreeSync, initSchemaSync and initSchemaColumnsSync run from main.ts's bootstrap() beside initApiDataSync(), not from ProjectTree.vue's onMounted, so windows with the project panel hidden or zero connections still get them.
Credential reveal is guarded against a draft swap while its async round trip is outstanding, so one connection's password cannot be written into another draft.
ensureSchemaColumns does not cache a failed fetch as an empty list, and has a generation guard so a stale in-flight fetch cannot overwrite a newer result after a drop.
Mounted console completion is re-warmed after a schema-columns drop (reconnect or tree Refresh).
hydrateOps subscribes to onOpUpdate before taking its opsRecent snapshot, so updates landing in between are not lost.
Tree loadChildren results that resolve after the connection's disconnect are dropped, and a collapse issued during an in-progress expand() is honored when expand() resolves.
Tab saves are serialized: enqueueSave chains every save through one persistent promise, coalescing intervening changes to the latest snapshot, and flushPendingTabState awaits the full chain. This is needed because Wails dispatches each bound call on its own goroutine and nothing serializes tabsSave calls DB-side.
Studio boot has an error path: BootFailure.vue (adapted from apps/kira-space) and a bootstrap() wrapper with Retry replace a blank window on hydrate rejection.
The mode store's debounced write is flushed via the native onFlushBeforeClose/onWindowFlushBeforeClose handshake (as createTabsStore.ts does), not browser beforeunload, which never fires when closing the last window because that path calls Hide(), not Close().
dataTabStateSchema fields all have .default(...) like sibling schemas, and hydrateTabs resets to the kind's defaultState() on a genuine parse failure rather than keeping raw state, avoiding NaN from pageIndex * pageSize.
CommandPalette is built on the vendored shadcn-vue CommandDialog.vue (reka-ui), which provides role=dialog, focus trap, focus restore, Escape and click-outside close, replacing a hand-rolled backdrop with aria-hidden that hid the palette from assistive tech.
Go's ConnectionsService.Connect never rejects for a bad connection; it resolves with an error status, so callers must check the status before running dependent SQL.
OperationsPanel's one-shot context-menu re-run uses the non-reactive ensureConnectedOnce, because a fresh useConnectionGate() there has no owning effect scope to dispose its computed()s. onReconnectAndLoad returns success/failure.
ConnectionDialog's Test result check uses a JSON.stringify content snapshot in addition to identity/editingId, because draft is mutated in place by v-model and identity alone misses in-flight field edits.
Mask rule changes (Upsert/Remove/RegenerateKey) are broadcast across windows via ChannelMaskRulesChanged (Go internal/bridge/{events,maskrules}.go, per-connection payload like schemaChanged), consumed by onMaskRulesChanged and state/maskRules.ts's initMaskRulesSync wired in main.ts.
initMaskRulesSync writes pushed rules/counts straight into the query cache with no writeGeneration guard, because mask rules take effect immediately with no local draft to race; a RegenerateKey payload makes receiving windows drop their cached correlation key.

### v1.9 P108 Part 13 Shared frontend base
Part 13 (shared frontend base, Stream B position 1 of 8) owns packages/{workbench,theme,kira-ui}/**, packages/shared/caps.ts, packages/shared/protocol/events.ts, and packages/shared/domain/{base64,color,connection,git,layout,path,repo,settings,shortcuts,tabs}.ts.
Part 13 closes first so Part 6 (gate G2) and every later TS chunk review against a settled base, because every TS chunk in both apps one-hops into it.
useVirtualRows in virtualRows.ts watches rowHeight()/rowHeights() and calls virtualizer.value.measure(), because estimateSize is not one of virtual-core's memo deps and measure was not re-triggered when heights changed with the same item count.
monacoTheme.ts normalizeColor draws a 1×1 fillRect and reads the pixel via getImageData, emitting #rrggbbaa, because Chromium and WebKit serialize color-mix() tokens as color() strings that the old rgba regex missed, resolving silently to Color.red in Monaco.
Monaco's 8-digit #rrggbbaa form is valid for token rules foregrounds as well as colors widget entries, per ColorMap.getId's regex in tokenization.js.
DateFormatField, FontSizeField and GitLogLevelField.vue tie their Label to the control via for+useId instead of wrapping the Reset button inside the label.
KuiDialog.vue and KuiPopoverPanel.vue must not put aria-hidden="true" on the backdrop when it is an ancestor of the panel, because it hides the whole dialog/popover subtree from assistive tech.
modalFocus.ts's watch is immediate with an onScopeDispose backstop, so a dialog that mounts already open still gets initial focus, Tab-trap and Escape handling.
TabStrip.vue no longer reassigns dragId to the hovered tab mid-drag, and createTabsStore's moveTab looks up the target's pre-removal index.
hydrateTabs syncs the defaulted tab's own active flag, not just activeIdByWorkspace, and closeOthers goes through setActiveTabId instead of setting keep.active directly.
confirmDialog.ts and useTextPrompt.ts settle a still-pending promise before a second call overwrites it.
createLayoutStore's applyRemote reapplies the still-pending local patch on top of a same-window layoutChanged echo.
createTerminalsStore only buffers output into the drain when byTabId still has the tab; routeTerminalData and applyTerminalStatus helpers were extracted from the onTerminal callback to stay under the lint cognitive-complexity ceiling.
shortcuts/keys.ts matches letter/digit chords against e.code instead of e.key, so Option-modified macOS shortcuts (e.g. tree.copyUri ⌥⌘C) match the physical key; this is unconfirmed on real macOS hardware.
shared/domain/path.ts canonicalPath keeps a lone separator instead of stripping the filesystem root down to an empty string.
KuiColumnResizeHandle.vue cleans up on pointercancel and lostpointercapture as well as pointerup, so an interrupted drag cannot leak window-level listeners or fire a stale change.
The --color-input Tailwind @theme collision: packages/theme/src/base.css:31 (var(--kira-bg-input), wins) shadows shadcn-bridge.css:74 (var(--input)); both resolve to #313131 so nothing is visibly broken. To be folded into P110 with --color-muted.
CommandPalette.vue (shortcuts/) and FkPreviewPopover.vue (views/grid/) in apps/kira-studio each hand-roll the backdrop-ancestor aria-hidden="true" shape outside the shared Kui components. They belong to Part 12 and Part 10 respectively.

### v1.9 P108 Part 14 Space git process layer
Part 14 owns apps/kira-space/internal/{gitclient,ghclient,gitpath,gitaskpass}/** (porcelain/testdata included).
gitclient is the bottom of Space's Go call graph (gitsession to gitclient has 265 edges); porcelain parsing and askpass are edge-case and security heavy.
parseDecorationToken ignores unrecognised bare %D tokens (such as a shallow clone's "grafted" marker or a replace ref's "replaced" token) as non-ref annotations instead of hard-erroring in ParseLogRecord.
On a split/parse error the log session's consumeChunkLocked calls failLocked, which kills the child git log process and marks the Session permanently failed; every later ReadPage returns the same error immediately.
gitsession/walk.go readPageLocked resets the walk on a log-session error, so a permanently failed Session does not wedge every future loadMore; the failing read still surfaces its own error.
The 0x1f field separator can appear inside non-last fields (hostile author/committer/tagger names or emails), so log, scan and tags formats use NUL as field delimiter, and the stash format puts its message field (%gs) last.
porcelain.FieldGrouper groups a flat NUL-field stream into fixed-size records; ParseLogRecord and ParseScanRecord take pre-split fields, and ParseLogRecordFromRaw handles one-shot show -s -z. logsession.Session and gitsearch.Scan each use a FieldGrouper alongside their RecordSplitter.
gitclient forces -c diff.suppressBlankEmpty=false in configOverrides because a user's diff.suppressBlankEmpty=true makes git print a bare empty line for blank context lines; parseOneHunk also tolerates a bare empty line.
Run/reap use a buffered path (Spec.buffered/startBuffered) with direct io.Writers instead of StdoutPipe/StderrPipe, because os/exec pipes have no copy goroutine so cmd.WaitDelay cannot force-close them and a hook's backgrounded process holding stdout/stderr would block Run and Repo.Write indefinitely.
startStreaming (used by logsession, gitsearch, catfile) remains pipe-based; Process.Wait() now carries Stdout directly.
catfile requestPipelined calls fail() before waiting on writeErrCh on a response error, to avoid deadlock when the writer goroutine is stuck on a full stdin pipe; stdin is captured to a local before the writer goroutine starts.
catfile Read does a second size-gate check inside the same closure that holds the size, since a mutable rev can resolve differently if HEAD moves; an oversize blob is still fully drained and not counted as a failure.
catfile readHeader treats an " ambiguous" reply (short-OID collision) by suffix like " missing", not as a protocol error that would permanently trip the circuit breaker.
catfile Check/Read/CheckMany and persistentProcess request/requestPipelined take a ctx; a watchCtx helper closes the process on cancellation.
catfile ReadOneShot runs cat-file -s before the unbounded read so the size gate is exact before any content is read.
buildEnv strips GIT_DIR, GIT_WORK_TREE, GIT_INDEX_FILE, GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY, GIT_COMMON_DIR and GIT_NAMESPACE from the parent environment before spawning git, since passing them through would silently retarget every spawn.
Repo uses a pendingWriters counter so that once a Write is pending, new Read admissions are refused (already-admitted reads are unaffected), preventing readers from starving a Write.
Stash header detection (isStackStashHeader/isGlobalStashHeader) consumes a rename's two numstat path records structurally via collectNumstatRecs/isRenameNumstatRecord, so header-shaped renamed filenames do not split into phantom entries.
MergeTreeArgs uses -z (requires git 2.38+) because default LF framing C-quotes conflicting paths containing quote/backslash/tab/LF; ParseMergeTreeOutput parses NUL framing.
ResolveHead reads plain symbolic-ref -q HEAD and strips refs/heads/ itself, because --short yields "heads/<b>" when a tag shares the checked-out branch's name.
Never assume SHA-1 in code, because SHA-1-only literals break every SHA-256 repository: get the empty tree hash from a real hash-object -t tree /dev/null spawn (EmptyTreeHashArgs/ParseEmptyTreeHash), accept 40 or 64 hex in stash isHexObjectID, and keep IsUncommittedBlameSHA width-agnostic.
UncommittedBlameSHA is kept for SHA-1 back-compat.
gitsession/working.go WorkingDetail spawns EmptyTreeHashArgs() itself on an unborn branch, replacing the removed EmptyTreeSHA constant.
gitaskpass buildShim single-quotes each helper-command element (shellQuoteSingle, '\'' idiom) so the shell cannot expand $var, $(...) or backticks; double-quoting allowed command injection.
The gitaskpass helper reads SSH_ASKPASS_PROMPT: "none" exits 0 without contacting the broker; "confirm" sends Request.Confirm (Masked false), never prints the answer, and conveys the decision by exit code alone.
fseventsBackend.run()'s inner per-event select has a case for b.stopping so it abandons a blocked batch send and returns to the outer drain loop; Close() closes stopping before es.Stop(). The file is darwin+cgo only.

### v1.9 P108 Part 15 Space git preflight, ops, review, search and graph store
RunRemote's protected-branch gate and PushPreflight's ClassifyPushInput.Branch use the resolved upstream remote branch name (resolveUpstreamRemoteBranch), not local params.Branch, because a force-push lands on the upstream name, which can differ (e.g. local feat tracking origin/main).
deleteRemoteBranch is unaffected by the upstream-resolution fix because its params.Branch already names the remote branch directly.
ClassifyInProgress uses SequencerTodoKind, read from the first pending command in sequencer/todo (mirroring git's wt-status.c), to re-derive revert/cherryPick when every *_HEAD file is gone, e.g. after a paused multi-commit revert/cherry-pick was finished with plain git commit.
A plain git am shares rebase-apply/ with an apply-backend git rebase, distinguished only by the applying marker file; it is reported only, with every Can* flag false, and no new am InProgressKind is added because that would change the git-ipc wire contract (Part 17's boundary).
head-name and onto are also read from rebase-apply/, not only rebase-merge/, so HeadName/OtherSha are populated there too; the operation classification changes are mirrored in the TS twin packages/git-core/src/model/operation.ts.
classifyOpErrorRules is an ordered table of whole-blob strings.Contains checks, so user-controlled text (commit subjects, file paths) could misclassify errors; a line-anchored Conflict check now runs first, matching only lines starting with 'error: could not apply ', 'error: could not revert ' or 'conflict ('.
PullConfigArgs applies regexp.QuoteMeta to the branch name in its --get-regexp pattern, as BranchConfigRegexpArgs does, because unescaped names like feat+x match the wrong key and a(b makes git config exit 6, failing PullPreflight.
MapRebaseValue (exported from gitpreflight) accepts all of git's case-insensitive boolean synonyms (yes/on/1, no/off/0) and short forms i/m, so e.g. pull.rebase=yes no longer falls through to the ff-only default.
pull.rebase=merges passes --rebase-merges via a rebaseMerges bool in gitops.RebaseArgs; gitpreflight.WantsRebaseMerges is asked by the executor re-reading the same config spawn PullPreflight made, avoiding a PullStrategy wire-union widening (git-ipc contract change, Part 17's boundary).
Known limitation: an explicit pull strategy override is indistinguishable, from the config re-read, from one the config ladder produced; closing it needs a git-ipc contract change.
No TS twin exists for pull preflight logic: packages/git-core/src/preflight/ holds only reset.ts and tag.ts.
When a prepare script exits 0 but a background process keeps stdout/stderr open, cmd.Wait returns a wrapped exec.ErrWaitDelay; Run treats it as a normal result, taking the exit code from cmd.ProcessState, and sets the new additive Result.Incomplete field to mark a possibly incomplete transcript. gitsession/worktree.go does not yet read it.
On prepare-script timeout/cancel, SIGKILL is sent to the whole process group immediately and unconditionally after Wait returns (ESRCH tolerated), so SIGTERM-trapping descendants cannot outlive the documented 15-minute hard timeout; this is safe from pid reuse because Linux does not free a PGID while any member is alive.
The delayed escalation SIGKILL timer must never separately fire after Wait returns; the G31 round-2 #11 regression test expects exactly one prompt SIGKILL.
resolveStackBase checks that the parent ref exists in the parentIsStacked branch too, so a branch on a parent whose ref was removed (git update-ref -d leaves kirastack config) becomes a visible orphan, preserving BuildStacks' contract of never dropping a branch.
In a shared checkout, run git add and git commit in one shell invocation and check git show --stat HEAD against the intended file list, because a concurrent session's staged files can land in the same index and be swept into the commit.

### v1.9 P108 Part 16 Space git session
Part 16 (Space git session) owns apps/kira-space/internal/gitsession/**; one-hop neighbours are gitrpc (153 edges), gitsock, gitaskpass, the Space bridge and main.go wireGit; callees are Parts 14-15, codeworkspace and storage.
Preflight RPC entry points (preflight.checkout target, revertMergeParents shas, preflight.cherryPick sha, preflight.stashPop targetSha) are guarded by validOpArg in gitsession, with a second validRefArg layer in gitrpc handlers (refs.go, reset.go, stash.go), because a client value with a leading '-' reaches git argv as a flag (e.g. --output=<path> on git show/git diff writes or truncates an arbitrary file).
PushPreflight carries a ResolvedBranch field (Go, @kira/git-ipc, git-core mirrored type) holding the resolved upstream branch name, because the backend requires ConfirmToken to equal the resolved upstream branch name while ForcePushDialog.vue could only use the local name.
ForcePushDialog.vue (packages/git-ui/src/components/dialogs/, Part 19's file) was minimally changed to gate, display and send the resolved branch name instead of the local one; flagged for Part 19's reviewer.
RunRemote resolves the upstream branch name once per call and threads it through the gate, lease check and runPushFamily spawn, instead of three separate resolveUpstreamRemoteBranch reads.
RepoEntry subscriptions (e.subs) are keyed by a per-call monotonic subscriptionID (counter under e.mu, never reused) instead of ConnID, because concurrent repo.open calls on one connection overwrote each other's subscriber and could leave zero subscribers, so no repo.changed delivery.
logsession.Session exposes Failed() bool (apps/kira-space/internal/gitclient/logsession/session.go, Part 14's file, flagged for Part 14's reviewer); walk.go readPageLocked resets the walk only when w.log.Failed(), so a client cancel or transient read error no longer discards the loaded store.
runPullOp checks whether the pulled branch is still checked out inside the Repo.Write closure using a fresh gitclient.ResolveHead (never cached), immediately before the merge/rebase spawns, because the cached e.Head check before acquiring Write left a race window.
wantsRebaseMerges re-runs ResolvePullStrategy with a fresh cfg and adds --rebase-merges only when the result's source is config-derived (SourceBranchConfig/SourcePullConfig), and surfaces config-read errors instead of swallowing them.
Open item: an explicit pull strategy override is indistinguishable from a config-produced one in wantsRebaseMerges; a follow-up needs a @kira/git-ipc wire-contract change threading the resolved PullStrategySource (or a plain rebaseMerges bool) from remote.pullPreflight's result into remote.run's request params. It belongs in Part 17's boundary (gitrpc and the wire contract), like Part 15's F3 (am InProgressKind widening), and is to be added to SPEC.md.
Conn.Walk swaps the walk slot under c.mu and disposes the old walk only after unlocking, because dispose() takes the walk's lock, which a running Stream holds across page reads and emit backpressure; this keeps subscribers from blocking behind a page read. CloseRepo/Close use the same shape.
A disposed Walk has a disposed flag set in dispose(); ReadPage, Stream, Status, Search (and resetLocked) check it first and refuse with ErrRepoNotHeld, so stale handler references cannot spawn a git log process that lingers until the 5-minute idle reclaim.
RunOp and RunRestack clear e.undo once before the first write, so a prior op's undo record does not survive a later op that partially wrote then failed; CancelRestack racing the Repo.Write gate wait in runRestackSpawn maps ErrCancelled to the Cancelled OpResult.
RepoEntry has a cacheGen counter, bumped by invalidateAfterWrite and note's refsChanged branch alongside every cache drop; Refs/CommitDetail/Stacks/mergeBase/statusAndInProgress capture it before spawning and write back to cache only if it still matches, preventing stale reads from clobbering invalidated caches.
The repo-wide open-PR snapshot matches a branch only when ghclient.PR.HeadRepoOwner equals repo.Owner (empty when head.repo is null), falling through to the per-branch query on mismatch, so fork PRs from commonly named branches are not badged onto same-named local branches.
RunOp runs a whole argvList (e.g. auto-stash push then switch for checkout) under ONE Repo.Write acquisition via runWriteArgvList; if the switch fails after the stash succeeded, the error message names the exact stash ref (fresh rev-parse refs/stash).
Registry.release calls closeCatFile after releasing reg.mu (refcount and linger timer bookkeeping stay under the lock), because closeCatFile can block on an in-flight request such as a slow lazy-object fetch in a partial clone and would block other repos' Acquire/release/IsOpen/ReconcileAutoFetch. closeCatFile is idempotent and guarded by entry-local catfileMu.
Compute under the lock and run slow or blocking work (dispose, closeCatFile) after releasing it, to avoid stalling other lock users.
When working concurrently with other sessions in a shared checkout, git add only your own files and check git status and git show --stat HEAD immediately after every commit, because the shared index leaks other sessions' staged changes into commits.
Concurrency-sensitive regression tests in gitsession (F3, F7, F9's restack-cancellation case) are run under -race.

### v1.9 P108 Part 17 Space git RPC, socket server and `git-ipc` contract
verifyClientToken in gitsock is tri-state (tokenVerified/tokenInvalid/tokenLookupFailed); on a trust-store lookup failure runHandshake closes the connection with no frame instead of sending tokenRejected.
The extension treats a tokenRejected frame as authoritative and deletes its stored token, forcing a re-pair; so a transient trust-store error (SQLite busy/locked, DB closing) must never be answered with tokenRejected.
The dummy verifyToken call is kept on the lookup-failed path so handshake timing stays uniform (D6).
The pairing Broker returns PairingAborted (not PairingDenied) for non-decisions: closed guard, queue-cap (200 requests), and Shutdown/Request after Shutdown. runHandshake answers it with the no-frame close so the client backs off and redials.
A pairingDenied frame sets a terminal state in the extension that only a manual retry() clears, so pairingDenied must be sent only for a real user Deny (the Broker cooldown short-circuit in Request stays PairingDenied).
Broker.Cancel(requestID) removes a still-queued pairing entry and resolves it PairingAborted; it is a no-op if already resolved.
During runHandshake's row-7 wait (up to 120s for pairing approval), a watcher goroutine does a 1-byte Peek on the connection's reader while the request is queued; a read error cancels the entry, so an Approve cannot mint a trusted git_clients row for a disconnected requester.
The watcher stop sequence sets a past read deadline to unblock Peek, waits for the watcher goroutine to exit, and only then clears the deadline, before the connection is handed to Serve, so nothing reads it concurrently.
The handshake's first Receive() has a 10s read deadline, because readFrame allocates the declared body (up to the 8 MiB cap) before reading it and a silent or trickling local client would otherwise hold a goroutine, fd and memory until Server.Close.
hello.Client.ID is capped at 256 bytes; an oversized ID is rejected as row 1 (silent close).
In the VS Code extension connection.ts, #disconnectHandledFor = dialToken is set synchronously before awaiting secrets.delete in the tokenRejected branch, and #dial() clears #reconnectTimer at its top, so a server-side close after tokenRejected does not cause a double dial.
ConnectionManager in kira-space-vscode has no test harness mocking vscode.ExtensionContext/net.Socket, so the F14 reconnect-ordering fix has no dedicated test.
remote.pullPreflight and remote.run strategy fields are not validated against the TS literal set; this is an open item handed off to P111.

### v1.9 P108 Part 18 `git-core` and `git-ui` logic
GraphViewState.reset() aborts #loadController and bumps #loadGeneration; #runLoad's post-request resync checks that generation, so a repo switch mid-load cannot reopen the old repo's graph stream over the new one.
BridgeClient re-establishes a held repo on host reconnect, so *State classes are not left pointed at a repo the host no longer considers open.
StackState.runRestack reconciles undo/inProgress from the restack result and re-checks repo identity before applying, matching other op-running methods' post-write step.
OpsState refreshes refreshUndo() on every repo.changed event, not only setRepoId, because the undo slot is shared per RepoEntry and another surface's write must be observed.
Reload-shaped methods in ops.ts, stack.ts, refs.ts, worktrees.ts and stash.ts route through createLatestRequest so an older reply arriving after a newer one is dropped; repoSettings.ts uses a shared #generation counter instead because its own set() must never drop its own result as stale.
PendingSlot.abandon() shares resolve()'s settle closure; OpsState.setRepoId/dispose use it to settle every pending confirm dialog and pull prompt with its cancel value, so a repo switch mid-dialog does not leave busy stuck true.
worktreePrepareOutput uses a private #worktreePrepareBuffer appended and trimmed in place with triggerRef, capped at WORKTREE_PREPARE_OUTPUT_LIMIT (500 lines, mirroring the server's retained-transcript bound), instead of re-spreading the array per ~100ms batch (O(n²)).
ReviewSessionState uses a #sessionGeneration counter (bumped by setTarget/setBase/dispose) and a dedicated #checkController, checked before #checkForChange applies its result, so a stale background re-resolve cannot overwrite a newer selection.
PrState uses a #clearGeneration counter bumped by #clear() to gate ensureSnapshot's worker pool and resolveBranch's stale-reply guard; #branchRequests cleanup is conditional so it never deletes a newer request's in-flight marker.
Fire-and-forget reload()/refreshX() calls in ops.ts, stack.ts, refs.ts, worktrees.ts, stash.ts and repoSettings.ts route through a per-class #logBackgroundError (graphView.ts #runAutoRefresh does so inline) to avoid unhandled rejections; the underlying methods still throw for direct callers.
GraphViewState #applyChunk folds a chunk into the store and returns without awaiting relayout, which unblocks rpc.ts's per-chunk credit gate; #drainLayoutRebuilds reruns #rebuildLayout only while a newer range landed, coalescing relayouts for large loads (e.g. 200k-row rehydration, 400 wire chunks).
git-core structural type copies must be kept in sync with contract.ts by hand, because tests/unit/ipc/wireConformance.test.ts does not exist in this repo; contract.ts's doc comment documents this.
git-core copies were synced to contract.ts: OpErrorKind gained 'BranchChanged', StashEntry gained scope/ref, CheckoutPreflight.routes gained 'autoStash'/'detachHere', HostKind gained 'kira'.
HostKind and CheckoutPreflight in git-core have no git-core consumer today.
The shared full-monorepo pre-commit hook runs long enough to create a race window in a shared checkout, where one fixer's git commit can absorb another's staged-but-uncommitted changes and index.lock contention can occur.

### v1.9 P108 Part 19 `git-ui` components
CommitGrid row conversion is guarded against a row plan that no longer matches the current chunk state on a cold-boot scrollRow restore.
Context-menu targets in git-ui are captured at open time, and the menu closes on a graph.refresh or repo switch instead of trusting a live row lookup, hooked into App.vue's handleRepoOpened/applyRepoIdToStates lifecycle point.
On a repo switch or reconnect, App.vue also clears the repo-settings dialog and any open menu refs, so destructive actions (reset, stash drop) cannot fire against the wrong repo's state.
RepoState.open sequences overlapping opens with an openSequence token, mirroring Part 18's GraphViewState#loadGeneration pattern, so a stale open cannot clobber a newer one.
Selection and scroll position are preserved across a reconnect instead of resetting to a cold-boot default.
ReviewView uses a targetSequence counter so a review.target push arriving during repo.list is not overwritten by the workspace default that resolves afterward.
bootstrap() in App.vue and ReviewView.vue disposes/unsubscribes prior state at entry before recreating it, so retries do not leak subscriptions.
The shared retryBootstrap helper in state/bootstrap.ts takes an optional onSuccess callback so App.vue's cold-bootstrap pendingUiAction fires exactly once, whether the first attempt or a retry succeeds.
The boot-error banner renders above every repoState sub-branch, and NoRepositoryPanel.vue has its own refreshError/Retry so a failed refreshList() reads distinctly from no folder being a Git repository.
ReviewCommitRow.vue builds menuSections/onMenuSelect from props.actions (always available) rather than props.expansion?.actions, which is undefined until the row is first expanded.
Fire-and-forget async sites in App.vue, ReviewView.vue, ReviewCommitRow.vue and NoRepositoryPanel.vue route rejections through reportAsyncError or a local try-catch that ignores TransportError('transport-closed') and otherwise surfaces the message on the announcement/live-region surface.
App.vue's startDetailResize uses pointer events with setPointerCapture and VueUse's useEventListener for window-level listeners, fixing a stuck-drag bug that predates P105; KuiColumnResizeHandle.vue uses the same shape.
App.vue's onDocumentKeydown acts only if the event landed inside this instance's root, or falls back to this instance's own graphVisible flag (useGraphVisible()) when focus is elsewhere.
App.vue's onClickOutside targets a template ref scoped to its own overlay aside rather than document.querySelector, which could resolve to another mount's identically-testid'd element.
ReviewView.vue's onDocumentKeydown is scoped via a rootEl template ref; root containment alone suffices because it has no KeepAlive/visibility concept.
main.ts provides GRAPH_VISIBLE_KEY unconditionally for every mount (view 'graph' or 'review'), so the graphVisible fallback behaves identically regardless of host.
Skip unit tests for simple prop or scoping fixes; per CLAUDE.md's unit-test bar, write regression tests only for complex or hard-to-get-right logic such as races and sequencing.

### v1.9 P108 Part 20 Kira Space hosts — desktop app and VS Code extension
GitClientsService.AttachPush in apps/kira-space/internal/bridge/gitclients.go subscribes to gitsock.Server's OnPairingChanged/OnClientsChanged and emits the kira:git:pairing and kira:git:clients push events; main.go wires it and detaches it in teardown.
Frontend main.ts mounts a BootFailure.vue island with Retry on any hydrate rejection; essential hydrates run in Promise.all, non-essential (gitClients/terminals) in Promise.allSettled so one optional store cannot block the shell.
In transport.ts, onClose deletes the shared-client map entry only when it still points at the transport that fired it, so a late async onClose cannot evict a newer shared client.
codeworkspace.Session has a closed flag under its own mutex and ErrSessionClosed; catfileSession() returns the error on a closed session instead of spawning a new cat-file pair, and BeginSearch() returns an already-cancelled context.
In main.go teardown, CodeWorkspaceService.Shutdown must run before repositories.Close(), because a running search still reads settings through Deps.Repos.
main.go teardown calls gitRegistry.Close() unconditionally after gitSock.Close(), because gitsock.Server.Close() can early-return; Registry.Close and gitreview.Store.Close are idempotent.
Kira Space enforces a single instance: main.go acquires an app.lock file via exported gitsock.AcquireLock before storage.Open and exits with os.Exit(0) if another instance owns the home, so a second launch cannot silently share kira.db.
The app lock must be a different file from git.sock.lock, because flock is scoped to the open file description, so reusing the path would make gitsock.Server.Start's own AcquireLock in the same process see its own first instance as another instance.
startupfail.StepInstanceLock is the startup-failure step for the real-error path of instance locking, following the existing Step/Classify pattern.
The VS Code extension's .vscodeignore excludes tests/**, playwright.config.ts, test-results/** and playwright-report/**, so the .vsix contains only package.json, README.md, LICENSE, resources/** and dist/**.
The build:vsix Taskfile sources list includes packages/git-ui/vite.config.ts, apps/kira-space-vscode/README.md and bun.lock as real build inputs.
In the VS Code extension, ConnectionManager checks vscode.env.remoteName at construction; in Remote-SSH workspaces it skips the dial loop and goes to a denied reason 'remote' with a distinct message, and retry() is a no-op for that reason.
The VS Code extension uses connection.ts's exported socketPath() for the git socket path in the status bar and commands instead of hardcoding ~/.kira-space/git.sock.
fakeReviewHost.ts exports a FakeReviewHostWindow interface naming the three window globals, which review-target-race.spec.ts uses to avoid biome noExplicitAny warnings.
ReadFile and scanFile check Mode().IsRegular() on the pre-open os.Stat before os.Open, then read through io.LimitReader, because os.Open (not os.Stat) blocks on a FIFO with no writer, so open-then-stat would not close the hang.
Regression tests are written only for concurrency/race/hang-shaped fixes, per CLAUDE.md's unit-test bar; wiring, build-list, type-only and os.Exit changes get no dedicated tests.

### v1.9 P109 True up `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md`, every README and `CLAUDE.md`'s own stale pointers against...
P109 is the closing documentation phase of v1.9: it trues up docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md, CLAUDE.md and the READMEs against the repo state after P108, with no app behavior changes and no .vue/.ts/.go source edits.
When trueing up docs, verify claims against the actual repo state, not earlier phases' result-section prose, because that prose goes stale (e.g. startupfail listed as a git package, a stale command count, a stale ContractVersion).
In CLAUDE.md's "prune as you go" rule, remove only dead pointers (references to deleted files/subsystems or already-answered questions); process rules stay.
docs/ARCHITECTURE.md's Quick open (C9) subsection was removed outright, along with its four Known open items entries.
In docs/ARCHITECTURE.md the "The native code workspace (C5-C7, P67c)" section sits inside "## Git module", immediately before "Git graph in the native workspace (C10)".
The P72/P79 KeepAlive graph tab persistence is dead code in both Kira Space and Studio: neither app's shared MainView.vue wraps its dynamic component in a KeepAlive any more. Graph tab continuity comes from TabViewStateStore persist/restore.
The dead KeepAlive graph tab persistence is recorded as a Known open item in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (Kira Space block) rather than fixed, because fixing it is a source change outside a docs-only phase.
Kira Space has no e2e-real test tier for git pairing; this is recorded as a Known open item in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md.
docs/DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md's DB MCP port note no longer says "OS-assigned", and the doc still contains the sentence "no `bun run mcp:*` script exists".
docs/DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md has shadcn-vue and CodeGraph sections.
packages/api-ui and packages/ui-kit do not exist; the docs mention them only to say so.
Verified counts at the end of v1.9: 29 bound services in Studio and 10 in Space (counted via application.NewService); gitrpc has 56 requests plus 1 stream; gitstream.go's allowlist is 53+1=54.
ContractVersion is 41 on both the Go and TypeScript sides; the VS Code extension (kira-space-vscode) has 47 commands in contributes.commands.
The Studio frontend has 20 components/ui sets, 70 defineStore calls and 8 settings sections.
The storage migration high-water mark is 0027 for Studio; Kira Space has 2 migrations.
Test inventory at end of v1.9: tests/ui has 283 tests in 53 spec files; visual has 6 specs and 13 snapshots; e2e-real has 4 specs and 6 tests; db-fixtures/support has 7 modules.
docs/v1.9/README.md was added in P109; the plan lives at docs/v1.9/plans/P109-docs-trueup.md.
The P113 row in SPEC.md still claims P113 runs "last … after P112", which is stale because P114 now follows it in the phasing table.
Stale source comments remain for a later phase to decide on: connections.go:172 nativeKinds mention, two quickOpen.ts references, internal/datagrip/jdbc.go comment about CLAUDE.md's per-adapter port literals, two comments naming deleted IconButton/PopoverPanel, and RepoGraphView.vue:10 "(Studio only)".

### v1.9 P110 Fix the `--color-muted`/`--color-input`/`--color-border` `@theme` collision, folded into the full CSS-to-Tailwind mig...
Before P110, base.css's @theme re-declared --color-muted, --color-input and --color-border, which shadcn-bridge.css's later @theme inline already owns; under Tailwind v4's last-definition-wins rule the legacy gray/border values won app-wide and shadcn bg-muted/border-input consumers rendered the wrong fill.
P110 fixed the collision by renaming legacy consumers (bg-input to bg-field, text-muted to text-muted-foreground) and deleting base.css's duplicate @theme lines, so each of the three names is defined once, resolving to shadcn's value.
Give each @theme name exactly one definition, because under Tailwind v4 the last definition wins and silently overrides shadcn values; the rule and the escape-hatch rule are in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, and check-theme-classes.sh guards it in bun run lint.
P110 was a single phase, not split into CLAUDE.md Part N parts, because one grep set over one end state is the acceptance and the coordinator asked for two parallel implementers; it ran as two file-disjoint streams: Stream A (git-ui, kira-ui, kira-space-vscode) and Stream B (theme, workbench, both apps' frontends).
P110 widened by explicit user request from the narrow collision fix to the full CSS-to-Tailwind migration audit (~250 files, ~8,000 CSS lines), so primitives.css, workbench.css and scoped style files are not reopened in a later phase.
Iteration 2 included 4 user-approved amendments: one 1s animate-spin, Alert err variant collapsed onto destructive, one canonical colour/radius name per value repo-wide, and all reka SplitterGroup/SplitterPanel call sites converted to the shadcn-vue Resizable wrappers.
git-ui has its own prefixed, kv:-scoped Tailwind v4 root, and kira-ui gets cn() and a theme partial; packages/kira-ui/src/theme/controls.css was deleted and Kui* components moved onto cva variants or kv: utilities.
Dialog widths became utilities and DialogContent no longer has shadcn's sm:max-w-sm cap.
Keep kv-* marker classes that specs and scripts query when converting to utilities, because Stream A's conversion removed them and A-fix had to restore them.
B34's shared @utility virtual-row/sticky-row lost to an unlayered scoped position: relative, which collapsed virtualized rows.
NativeSelect's own v-model overrode a raw :value at 9 call sites, a real bug fixed in P110.
scripts/check-class-conflicts.ts runs inside bun run lint; missing tailwind-merge groups are registered so cn() merges kira scales.
Shared components replaced pasted class strings in iteration 2: Empty, TreeTwisty, RunState, NumberStepperInput, ViewToolbar, SwatchRadio, and settings fields on Field/Label.
P110 end state at 0491dae: packages/theme/src/base.css holds exactly 4 @utility blocks, and only 5 .vue files keep a style block (MonacoHost, OperationsPanel, ResponseDiffDialog, RepoFileView, CommitGrid), down from 149.
primitives.css went from 1013 lines to 75, and workbench.css is down to 2 non-comment lines.

### v1.9 P111 Thread the pull-strategy ladder's resolution source through the `git-ipc` wire contract, so a config-derived `--rebas...
Before P111, the pull-strategy result reaching remote.pullPreflight could not distinguish an explicit kiraSpace.pull.strategy override of "rebase" from a git-config-derived one, so a config-derived --rebase-merges could wrongly apply to an explicit override.
An explicit Kira Space pull.strategy override of "rebase" never adds --rebase-merges even when the repo's git config says pull.rebase=merges; a git-config-derived "merges" resolution still does.
The fix was a git-ipc wire-contract change deferred out of P108 Part 16 into a named follow-up phase, because CLAUDE.md's exception reserves non-mechanical contract changes with design decisions for such phases.
remote.pullPreflight's strategySetting is validated against model.ValidPullStrategy and remote.run's strategy against a closed validPullStrategy vocabulary at the gitrpc layer, both refusing with ipcerr.BadRequest before any spawn.
The pure function gitpreflight.ResolveRebaseMerges replaced gitsession.wantsRebaseMerges, which was deleted; runPullOp now reads params.RebaseMerges instead of re-deriving it.
The wire contract carries rebaseMerges as PullPreflight.RebaseMerges and RemoteOpParams.RebaseMerges (Go) with TS mirrors in contract.ts and git-core, and remote.run has a rebaseMerges guard.
In git-ui, runPull sends preflight.rebaseMerges for the preflight-resolved strategy and false for an explicit strategy override.
The git-ipc contract version was bumped 40 → 41 (ContractVersion in Go, CONTRACT_VERSION in TS) as a breaking change, kept in lockstep with history comments and docs/ARCHITECTURE.md.
A git-ipc contract version bump must update every literal version in lockstep, including test assertions such as TestContractVersion_Is41 in gitrpc/stash_test.go and the embedded "version" in packages/git-ipc/testdata/graphChunkFrame.bin.
Do not regenerate graphChunkFrame.bin with TestFixtures_CaptureGraphChunkFrame (KIRA_GIT_FIXTURES=write) for a version bump, because it re-derives from a non-deterministic test repo (fresh commit SHAs, timestamps, repoId, JSON array reformatting) and adds unrelated noise. Patch the version bytes directly and revert any regenerator side effects.
Tests added: TestResolveRebaseMerges (8-case table of strategy x source x two config keys), an integration test proving RebaseMerges is false end to end when pull.rebase=merges is set with stored "rebase" strategy, and ops.test.ts cases for runPull rebaseMerges true (resolved) vs false (explicit rebase).
P111's change to the git-ipc contract required no changes to apps/kira-space-vscode/src/proxyHandlers.ts or apps/kira-space/internal/bridge/gitstream.go, and nothing under apps/kira-studio/ was touched.
Never use git commit --amend in a shared checkout, because it always amends whatever HEAD currently is (possibly another session's commit), not a specific commit this session made.
In a shared checkout, commit with a pathspec-scoped git commit -m message -- <files> instead of a plain git commit, because the shared index may hold another session's staged files that would otherwise land in the commit.
After each commit in a shared checkout, check its file list against the intended set with git show --stat, to catch commits that picked up foreign files or amended foreign commits.
The packages/git-ipc/testdata/graphChunkFrame.bin fixture is regenerated by TestFixtures_CaptureGraphChunkFrame, which only runs when KIRA_GIT_FIXTURES=write.
SPEC.md holds one row per phase and is updated as phases land or split.
The plans/ directory holds one implementation plan per phase, committed before that phase's implementation starts, written by an Opus subagent per CLAUDE.md's process, and never edited afterward.

### v1.9 P112 Move Studio API-client server state (collections tree, saved requests, variable rows, environments, active environmen...
Studio API-client server state (collections tree, saved requests, variable rows, environments, active environment) moves onto TanStack Query, invalidated by a Go-broadcast scoped api-data-changed event rather than a hand-rolled generation counter.
Before P112, the variables listCache, environment list, active environment and collections tree/saved-request caches did not invalidate across windows: edits in one window never reached another, and listCache never refetched once filled, so a stale entry could substitute stale plain values into every send.
The api-data-changed event payload is scoped and names what changed: a collection id, an environment id, or "environments list changed"; Go broadcasts it whenever a mutation lands.
P108 Part 9's F2/F9 fixes (per-key in-flight dedupe and generation guard on ensureVariablesLoaded, evicting a deleted owner's listCache entry) stay as landed; P112 replaces only the caching mechanism underneath them.
P112 was created as a follow-up phase (from P108 Part 9 finding F12) because the migration was too large for the review-fix chunk, using the same CLAUDE.md exception P110/P111 use.
Go emits api-data-changed through the emitApiData helper with the ApiDataChange scoped payload (bridge/apidata.go), wired into 19 mutation call sites in variables.go and collections.go under apps/kira-studio/internal/bridge/ (definition at apidata.go:30).
On the TS side, a boot-time listener turns an api-data-changed broadcast into queryClient.invalidateQueries; query keys and options live in apiQueries.ts.
Environments list state in variables.ts uses apiEnvironmentsQueryOptions with useQuery, and active-environment mutations use useMutation.
Variable rows use apiVariablesQueryOptions; listCache, ensureVariablesLoaded, cachedVariables and evictListCache were removed and replaced by pure functions mergeVariableRows and overviewRowsOf and async helpers variablesForSend and apiIdsForTab.
The collections tree, orphanRequests and orphanGrpcRequests use apiCollectionsTreeQueryOptions, with create/rename/delete as useMutation.
Saved requests use apiSavedRequestQueryOptions and apiSavedGrpcRequestQueryOptions, read reactively through useSavedRequest and useSavedGrpcRequest in both request views; useSavedRequest and useVariableRows are used by both HttpRequestView.vue and GrpcRequestView.vue.
loadCollectionsTree and loadEnvironments live in apiQueries.ts as queryClient.query-backed imperative loaders; the names are reused but the mechanism is new TanStack Query, not the old hand-rolled cache.
P112 removed the old cache identifiers state.requests, state.grpcRequests, listCacheGen, ensureInFlight and initInFlight; none remain outside comments.
useQuery/useMutation callers: collections.ts (1 query, 5 mutations), variables.ts (1 query, 8 mutations), and apiQueries.ts (3 useQuerys for saved request, grpc request and variable rows).
An unsaved in-progress draft in the active window must not be clobbered by a refetch triggered by a save in another window.
apiCollectionsTreeQueryOptions, apiSavedRequestQueryOptions and apiSavedGrpcRequestQueryOptions are not exported, since only apiQueries.ts uses them (knip flagged them).
grpc-schema-supersession.spec.ts hung after loadSchema began awaiting apiIdsForTab; P112 fixed it, resolving the deferral recorded in P108 Part 11.
Restore control.collectionsList and variablesListEnvironments after each spec file, because otherwise the control mock leaks across files.
api-cross-window-sync.spec.ts (3 cases) covers a variable edit reaching another window's next send, an active-environment switch reaching another window's selector, and a save not re-dirtying after its own event-triggered refetch; it stands in for the plan's §9.6 manual check.
In a shared checkout, check each commit's file list against its intended set, because a broad git commit sweeps in another session's staged files from the shared index.
CLAUDE.md requires implementing the whole plan first and then testing once at phase end.
The v1.9 chapter's lint:dead (knip) baseline is 6 duplicate-export pairs and 8 configuration hints.
build:studio emits a pre-existing INEFFECTIVE_DYNAMIC_IMPORT warning on monacoTheme.ts, which is not a failure.
GrpcRequestView.vue's schema-load watch returns early for descriptorMode 'reflection' with an empty target, so grpcDescribe never fires, methodResolved never resolves and the Call button stays disabled.
gRPC tab UI tests must set a target (e.g. demo.example.com:443) and a grpcDescribe snapshot mock when restoring a tab via grpcTab, or the Call button stays disabled.
The ui-timing Playwright project's tests are skipped via project dependency when the ui project has failures.
No automated spec covers a rename/delete in one window reaching another window's collections tree with the open tab reading orphan; it is unverified.
F2/F9 guarantee specs are api-variables-duplicate-names, api-variables-delete-eviction, api-variables-ensure-load-race and api-secret-reveal-expiry-round2.

### v1.9 P113 Second duplication sweep: CodeGraph re-run + jscpd/dupl tooling
P113 is a second duplication sweep that re-runs P107's method (S1 body hash, S2 name-collision, S3 callee-fingerprint LCS, S4 file-pair diff) only after P108-P112 all close, because earlier re-sweeping would re-find duplication those phases are mid-removing or mid-introducing.
P113 widens S3's threshold (previously LCS ratio ≥0.7 and ≥6 callees) to catch shorter/looser duplicates, rather than adding a third round of new sweep types.
jscpd (TS/Vue) and dupl (Go) are permanent, independently-installed devDependencies in the repo, not one-off scripts, per the user's explicit instruction, with dedup:ts and dedup:go package.json scripts.
jscpd and dupl are both MIT-licensed (dupl is MIT, not BSD-3-Clause as commonly assumed), so both pass CLAUDE.md's OSS-only license check.
P113 follows P107's loop: an Opus review pass writes findings only to a committed plans/ doc, then one sequential Sonnet fixer implements with a commit per finding, fast checks per commit, and full suites once near the end.
P113's planning pass re-checks each of P107 iteration 1's 12 explicit declines against the widened thresholds and the new tools, since declines made under a 0.7/≥6-callee or CodeGraph-only sweep may not hold.
The second sweep is its own phase (P113) rather than reopening closed P107, because CLAUDE.md's numbering rule gives a new phase the next sequential P number.
P113 added jscpd@5.3.2 with a root .jscpd.json and dedup:ts script, and dupl v1.1.0 as a Go tool dependency (go get -tool) with a dedup:go script; both are report-only and gate neither commits nor CI.
ipcerr gained InternalResult[T] and InternalErr helpers, replacing ipcerr.Internal(err.Error()) pass-throughs in bridge files; the one documented exception is apps/kira-space/internal/bridge/codeworkspace.go, since session()'s 3-value return fits neither helper.
adapters.Guarded was introduced across all 9 adapters (redis, sqs, postgres, mysqlfamily, sqlite, kafka, clickhouse, mongo, s3) for connection-state guards, and the getX/getReadOnly wrapper methods were removed.
relational.ConnState and Disconnect are shared between the postgres and mysqlfamily adapters; MarkPrimaryKey and BeginReadOnlyConsole are also shared helpers.
RequirePath is a shared fixed-depth path validator, migrated into the mysqlfamily, mongo, sqlite, clickhouse, kafka, sqs, redis and s3 adapters.
queryplan shares tableLabel and pushIndexIssues in queryplan/issues.go for MySQL/MariaDB, while raw schemas stay per-engine.
appstorage.ListWindowTabs and CheckWindow are shared across both apps; each app's TabsService is a thin bound-type delegate.
appstorage.QueryLeaves and UpsertLeafList are shared helpers for the layout repo.
The connections repo uses a private insertTx shared by Insert, InsertWithSecret and InsertDuplicateWithSecret; G11 landed before G12 per the plan's same-file ordering.
sqlitex.QueryOne[T] and NextSortOrder are shared helpers for sqlite repo Get-by-id and next-sort-order call sites.
The tree service uses a generic cacheAside[T] for Describe, Definition and SchemaColumns; Children keeps its own paging/invalidation logic.
gitsession detailCache and mergeBaseCache use github.com/hashicorp/golang-lru/v2 (v2.0.7, a direct require in go.mod); refsCache and stackCache use a generic valueCache[T].
Process-group kill and graceful cancel logic lives in the new internal/procgroup package; each of the 4 callers (gitclient, ghclient, gitprepare, toolexec) keeps its own killGroup/gracefulStopDelay test seams.
G13 deduplicated gitsession opslot.claim, gitrpc validReviewScope and postman importKeyValueRows.
GitPairingDialog's Deny focus and countdown re-arm per request id, because watching pending !== null stays true across a queue advance from request A to B and silently skipped the reset for B.
The shared usePendingDecision composable is used by both GitPairingDialog and DbMcpApprovalDialog.
TooltipIconButton is the shared tooltip-wrapped icon button component, migrated across about 150 sites in the initial sweep plus completion passes; 66 .vue files reference it.
RowActionsButton in git-ui builds on TooltipIconButton (F2), so F7 had to land after F2.
SlickGrid host shared helpers (gutterColumn, computeCellFillHash, renderedPageRowBand, subscribeRangeSelecting, subscribeRowHeight) live in views/shared/slick/gridHostShared.ts.
PagedViewRuntime, defaultPagedRuntime and applyPagePosition live in views/shared/viewOp.ts, and the stream view uses runPagedLoad.
SearchOptionToggles.vue in packages/workbench is shared by three search sites; a testidPrefix prop keeps each site's testids.
BootFailure.vue, bootstrapShell, terminalTabKind and defineAppViteConfig are shared cross-app frontend shell code in packages/workbench.
git-ui RepoScopedReload and FileListCursor are composed into the existing state classes, with latest-request-wins ordering unchanged.
pushIndexIssues is shared in views/console/planIssues.ts for MySQL/MariaDB plan parsers; raw schemas and MySQL's cost_info expansion stay per engine.
Putting ref on TooltipIconButton and reading x.value.$el doesn't reliably yield the real button DOM node, because Tooltip's teleported TooltipContent sibling breaks the single-root $el. This broke refocus-after-close and a popover anchor in 7 call sites. The fix exposes $el off the real template ref explicitly.
Wails requires bound types in each app's own package, so the ~29-line bridge tabs.go shell (struct, arg types, delegate calls to appstorage.ListWindowTabs/SaveWindowTabs) stays per-app in kira-space and kira-studio and still shows up in dedup:go.
No bound Wails method signature (parameters or return type) changed in P113 (acceptance criterion 5).
dedup:ts and dedup:go are report-only tools and are not expected to reach zero; residue such as tagRenderedRows in the SlickGrid hosts and the wrap helper in mariadb.ts/mysql.ts remains.
Per-commit rule in CLAUDE.md: each commit must pass fast checks (build, typecheck, lint, plus the owning package's go test); the expensive UI suites (test:ui:studio, test:ui:space, test:webview) take several minutes each.

### v1.9 P114 Investigate and fix the git-blame status-bar item's unreliable appearance in Kira Space's `test:ui:space` harness
The P76 test in repo-workspace.spec.ts (revision-pinned half) failed because it seeds an active restored repo-file tab whose boot opens the git transport (main.ts post-hydrate fall-forward mounts it before app.mount), but its git-stream mock was installed via page.evaluate after relaunch() resolved, too late.
Since commit cac7093b (react to the git transport's own stream closing, F3), an unmocked, closed git transport rejects file.read instead of hanging; this is correct app behavior, so RepoFileView never reaches state 'found' and the editor container does not render.
Before cac7093b the P76 revision-pinned half passed vacuously off a forever-loading empty host and never moved the cursor, so the blame.line guard it exists to prove was never exercised.
gitStreamMock.ts provides installGitStreamMockOnInit (page.addInitScript) for launches whose boot itself opens the git transport, while installGitStreamMock (page.evaluate) remains the per-spec default for other callers.
The git stream mock's browser-side installInBrowser logs every method seen in a t:'req' frame to window.__kiraGitRequests, read back via gitStreamRequests().
fixtures.ts RelaunchOptions has an optional gitStream field wired into installMocks, installed before relaunch()'s single navigation.
Git stream mock overrides passed via addInitScript must use null, not undefined, for 'repo.open', because addInitScript JSON-serializes its args and undefined would drop the key and hang repo.open forever.
The fixed P76 revision-pinned half asserts file content 'export const a = 1;' renders in .view-lines (proving RepoFileView's blameable guard ran), then after a click plus ArrowDown and ~500ms wait (>3x blameLine.ts's 150ms DEBOUNCE_MS) asserts file.read was requested, blame.line was not, and blame-status count is 0.
The P114 mutation check (dropping '&& rev === null' from the blameable guard at RepoFileView.vue:204) made the P76 test fail 3/3 at expect(requests).not.toContain('blame.line'), confirming the revision-pinned half is no longer vacuous.
The original P114 reported symptom (60s timeout on status-bar visibility, app never launching) did not reproduce; the actual deterministic failure was repo-workspace.spec.ts:531 expect(editor).toBeVisible() on repo-file-editor timing out at 5s with 'the transport was disposed' shown.

### v1.9 P115 Third duplication pass: fingerprint dimensions beyond call-sequence LCS
P113's S3 widening (LCS ratio ≥0.6, ≥4 callees counting resolved plus unresolved refs) found 835 of its 891 triaged pairs invisible to the original 0.7/≥6-resolved-callee cutoff, by adding unresolved callees to the callee-sequence fingerprint.
P113 declined to widen S3's threshold below 0.6/4 only because of hand-triage cost, not because callee-sequence LCS was the only fingerprint the graph data could support.
The duplication scans S1-S4 are custom scripts querying the .codegraph/*.db graph (nodes, calls edges, unresolved_refs); they are not a built-in CodeGraph feature.
P115 is a third duplication pass testing fingerprint dimensions other than callee-sequence LCS, to find real duplication that S1-S4 structurally can't see.
P115 candidate scan: type/interface-signature grouping, bucketing by normalized parameter/return types before diffing bodies, to catch same-interface-implementation duplication that S3 misses when callees differ per adapter.
P115 candidate scan: control-flow-shape fingerprint (branch/loop/switch/defer count and nesting, order-normalized) to catch copy-pasted dispatch/validation scaffolding whose branches call different things.
P115 candidate scan: literal/format-string fingerprint with identifiers blind but literal shapes kept, to catch error-message templates and SQL fragments, including drifted wording, like what G2 found by hand.
P115 candidate scan: struct/type field-shape fingerprint (same field names and types, different struct names) to catch data-shape duplication, which S1-S4 don't touch because they cover function/method bodies only.
P115 candidate scan: import-set pre-filter that buckets candidates by shared unusual import combinations before running LCS, so a lower threshold is affordable without the hand-triage volume that going below 0.6/4 would have caused in P113.
P115 is an Opus planning pass only, same split as P107/P113: build and run each new scan against the tree, triage by hand, and write findings plus a fix plan in the shape of docs/v1.9/plans/P113-duplication-sweep.md, with no fix implementation in this phase.
P115 is numbered as the next sequential P number per CLAUDE.md's numbering rule (one running sequence), and positioned last because it depends on P113's closed findings.

### v1.9 P116 Kira Space parity with Kira Studio on generic window chrome (menu bar, status bar, window lifecycle)
Kira Space and Kira Studio share packages/workbench and repo-root internal/shell; since P100 each app has its own main.go, menutemplate.go and App.vue.
Hoist Kira-Studio-only primitives to repo-root or packages/workbench so both apps bind the same implementation; never write a Space-only reimplementation.
P116 hoisted menu/keep-awake/metrics channel constants to internal/appevent, plus internal/keepawake, internal/metrics and AttachSystemWake (internal/shell) to repo-root; apps/kira-studio/internal/(keepawake|metrics|appshell/wake.go) are gone and Studio delegates.
internal/metrics provides NewAppTicker(appName), so the anchor needle is each app's own shipping executable name rather than a hardcoded AnchorNeedles.
AttachSystemWake lives in internal/shell and both apps' main.go call it; previously only Studio did.
createKeepAwakeStore and createAppMetricsStore Pinia store factories live in packages/workbench/src/state, and both apps' state/keepAwake.ts and state/appMetrics.ts call them.
TitleBarWindowActions.vue and AppMetricsItem.vue live in packages/workbench/src/components; both apps' TitleBar.vue and StatusBar.vue are thin callers.
Kira Space's menu has Settings… (⌘,), View › Toggle Project Panel (⌘B), dev-only Reload/Open DevTools, and Window-menu tab navigation, using the shared appevent channel constants (including ChannelOpenSettings, ChannelTabClose).
In Kira Space, Close Window is ⇧⌘W and ⌘W closes the active tab, matching Kira Studio's scheme; Studio's menu.go was not changed.
Kira Space keep-awake holds only the titlebar toggle reason, with no agent-hooks/Settings leaf (P100's design), unlike Studio's two reasons (toggle plus claudeCode.keepAwakeWithAgents).
Kira Space has a KeepAwakeService, WindowsService.OpenNewWindow wired to shell.OpenNewWindow in main.go (which also sets OnEmit and IsDev), and an app CPU/memory metrics ticker built via NewAppTicker.
Kira Space's state/tabs.ts has activateNextTab, activatePrevTab and closeActiveTab keyed on useWorkspaceStore().active, the analogue of Studio's useModeStore().active.
In Kira Space's main.ts, initAppMetrics() is in the critical boot Promise.all but initKeepAwake() is in the optional Promise.allSettled group, so a stuck OS power-assertion call cannot block boot; this deliberately differs from Studio.
state/tabs.ts, state/workspace.ts and state/repoTabs.ts form a circular import that is safe only via one existing entry point's ordering, as documented in tabs.ts's header comment.
In Kira Space, never import useTabsStore directly into App.vue; import it via the re-export in workbench/host.ts, because biome's organizeImports reorders it before ./workbench/host, adding a second cycle entry that left useTabsStore unbound on repo-row clicks.
The UI-spec keepAwakeStatus mock default lives in mockRuntime.ts WILDCARD_DEFAULTS with supported: true, not in bootSnapshots.ts, so the titlebar button renders by default in every spec (the UI suite runs against a static server, not a real Go build).
P119 (Kira Space release feed and update notifier) is a SPEC row appended after P118 and stays unimplemented, blocked on a release job and per-app tag scheme that are design decisions outside P116's scope.
budgets.spec.ts documents flakiness of its scroll-frame p50 timing as "cross-file worker contention" under a shared, CPU-constrained sandbox runner; it is not a deterministic regression.
The pr.yml CI patch names ./internal/metrics/... .
Space has a window-chrome.spec.ts UI test with 8 tests, bringing the test:ui:space suite to 28.

### v1.9 P117 Post-P110 Tailwind-migration visual misalignment sweep, Settings dialog and Api module named
P117 is a visual-QA sweep for misalignment after P110's CSS-to-Tailwind migration; it must launch running instances of the apps and screenshot surfaces, because lint, typecheck and existing test:visual snapshots only catch drift in states they already capture.
For each visual finding, name the offending Tailwind class by file:line and search with codegraph_explore for other call sites sharing the pattern, because a fix may need to land everywhere the class combination was copied during the migration.
P117 was appended as its own phase after P116 under CLAUDE.md's standing exception for a cross-cutting regression discovered outside any single in-flight phase's scope.
P117 ran as one Opus planning pass and one sequential Sonnet implementer with no stream split, because S1/S6/S7 share settings-pane files and A1/A2 share UI/toggle and UI/input primitives with Settings' steppers and selects.
S2 fix: DateFormatField.vue and GitLogLevelField.vue switched NativeSelect from :value/@change to :model-value/@update:model-value (as ApiPane does) because the select rendered blank.
S3 fix: the static hover:bg-hover in SettingsShell.vue and in DateTimePicker.vue's day/month/year cell grids moved into the inactive branch so the active item keeps its fill on hover, following GitPanel's precedent.
S1 fix: items-center was dropped from vertical Field layouts at 19 sites across 7 files (GitPane, RequestSettingsPane, AdvancedPane, ApiPane, AppearancePane, CachePane, DataPane), and self-start was added to selects that must stay narrow; the plan estimated 21 sites across 8 files.
S6 fix: text-kira-sm was added to the labels in FontSizeField.vue, DateFormatField.vue and GitLogLevelField.vue (WordWrapField.vue's precedent) to fix 14px settings labels, leaving the Label primitive untouched.
S7 fix: for checkbox rows with descriptions, the Label and FieldDescription are wrapped in FieldContent (shadcn's recipe) with items-start on the Field.
S8 fix: NumberStepperInput.vue's inner input uses AutocompleteField's allowlisted spin-button-hiding utilities to hide the native spinner inside steppers.
S4 fix: steppers stay w-full (as before P110), and FontSizeField.vue passes group-class="w-24" because it is the one caller needing a narrow stepper.
A1/S5: a kira size token was added to toggleVariants (Button's precedent) and applied as size="kira" to pane/tab ToggleGroup roots and RowDensityField.vue to fix stock ToggleGroup sizing.
A2: Input gained a kira/kira-lg size axis in inputVariants, and the default size stays byte-identical per P110 B25's InputGroup rule.
EnvironmentsView and VariableSetView filter InputGroups use bounded width and the kira variant, and their trailing action group has shrink-0 so the "New environment" button no longer clips.
A2 also sized inputs in VariableRow, SchemaBrowser, RequestSettingsPane timeout/limit fields, ResponseFindBar, TimestampPane, DateTimePicker hour/minute/second, and KeyValuePane's add/edit popover inputs (kira-lg).
PagerControls and SearchToolbar are already asserted at --kira-control-h by control-sizing.spec.ts, and FieldRowsTable's auto-height textarea rows are deliberate, so P117 left them alone.
P117 added UI-tier guards: control-sizing.spec.ts asserts the HTTP request pane's toggle-group-item height and environments-filter input-group height at --kira-control-h and that New-environment never clips; settings-apply-on-save.spec.ts and Space's window-chrome.spec.ts assert the date-format and git-log-level selects report a real value on open.
http-request-view.spec.ts is the Api module's first test:visual coverage, covering the method/URL bar, pane-switcher ToggleGroup, and response headers/body chrome on a sent 200 response.
ConnectionDialog's Port field shares NumberStepperInput with S8's spin-button fix, so S8 legitimately altered Studio's connection-dialog visual baseline (re-recorded though the plan expected it unchanged); a re-record commit for such a ripple must name S8 as the cause.
P117 touched no .go files, no bound Wails method signatures, and nothing outside apps/kira-studio/frontend/src, apps/kira-space/frontend/src, packages/{theme,workbench}/src and the two apps' tests/ui and tests/visual trees.
This repo never rewrites history, so P117's first 12 commits, which lack Co-Authored-By/Claude-Session trailers, stay as committed rather than amended.

### v1.9 P118 Fix P115's third-duplication-pass findings (H1-H10)
P118 fixes the 17 items across P115's findings H1-H10 (fingerprint-dimension duplication findings), using docs/v1.9/plans/P115-fingerprint-dimensions.md as its plan with no separate planning pass.
P118 fix work takes its own sequential P number rather than reopening P115, because P115 was investigation-only ("No fix implementation in this phase"), the same investigation-then-fix split as P107→P113, per CLAUDE.md's numbering rule.
P118 acceptance: each finding lands as its own refactor:/fix: commit (H4 is fix:) with fast checks; error text and behavior stay byte-identical unless a finding says otherwise; no bound Wails method signature changes; the plan's §4 closing run is green.
P118 must run only after P113 lands on the chapter branch, because H1-H3 sit on P113's G1/G2 shape and H4/H6/H9 sit near its F1/F4/F6/F8; the implementer rebases and re-reads every site since line numbers drift.
P118 is split into two file-disjoint streams: Stream A (Go: H1, H2, H3, H7, H8, H10) touching only *.go (plus 5 regenerated .fixture.ts mocks and docs), and Stream B (TS/Vue: H4, H5, H6, H9) touching only *.ts/*.vue, with zero overlap.
H2: redis, kafka, mongo, clickhouse and s3 depth-0 Children path-kind errors route through adapters.UnexpectedPathKind with byte-identical error text; variable-depth loop checks in redis/s3 stay hand-written because threading a depth would change their text.
H3: clickhouse and mongo readReq are aliases of adapters.ReadReq (as postgres/mysqlfamily/sqlite already are), and ClickHouse computeOrderBySql uses the newly exported adapters.ValidateRequestedTerms.
H1: adapters.ParseSSLMode(options, engine, accepted...) is the shared sslmode parser used by postgres, mysql-family, redis, mongo, kafka and clickhouse, keeping the refusal text '<engine>: unknown sslmode "x"'.
internal/terminal.OpenArgs fields are ordered to match both apps' TerminalOpenArgs exactly, because a Go struct conversion requires identical field order; both apps' Terminal-Open bridges pass terminal.OpenArgs(args) directly.
H7: toWireAgentEvent uses the conversion AgentEventWire(ev), and ApprovalPlanIssue/DbMcpApprovalPlanIssue element copies in dbmcp/explain.go and bridge/dbmcp.go are conversions; no wire shape, JSON tag or error text changed.
H8: gitpreflight's HeadStateFromBranch is exported and shared; gitsession converts at its own boundary with gitclient.HeadState(...), replacing its duplicate headStateFromStatusBranch.
H10: logBaseArgs takes the format string as a parameter (logBaseArgs(format string)) and LogScanArgs reuses it; argv order and content are unchanged.
Five frontend mock .fixture.ts files (clickhouse, kafka, mariadb, mysql, sqs) were regenerated because they were missing caps.keyTypes.
TestFixture_Redis in the on-demand ipcfixture suite fails because P113 G2 (689b6eea) narrowed redis/mutate.go resolveDatabaseSegment from any database-rooted path to RequirePath's exact-one-segment match, so the fixture's namespaced-key delete fails path validation.
Recommended fix for the redis regression: revert to the pre-G2 rooted-path check, or add a rooted-path variant to RequirePath; documented in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md and docs/v1.9/plans/P118-stream-a-findings.md.
App.vue had a hand-rolled copy of the detail-pane resize drag/keyboard logic that lacked the shared KuiColumnResizeHandle's primary-button guard, so right-clicking the handle started a drag.
KuiColumnResizeHandle has a direction prop ('normal' | 'reverse') so the right-docked detail pane, which widens as the handle moves left, can reuse it; the component also cleans up on unmount mid-drag.
buildReadOnlyRowMenu is a plain alias of buildReviewRowMenu, since they were verbatim duplicate copy-sha/copy-message-only menus; both call sites keep their own name.
ReviewSessionState#createRowActions uses createDetailActions, whose announce step is parametrized as (text) => void so both call sites share it.
SQL lex option types are consolidated on sql-lex.ts's SqlLexOptions: LintSqlOptions and SplitSqlOptions alias a new SqlScanOptions, SqlTokenOptions extends SqlLexOptions, and sql-split.ts and sql-lint.ts share one resolved-options resolver.
simpleObjectMenu was removed because it equaled copyNameItems(row, true); connectionMenu, containerMenu and callers use copyNameItems from menuItems.ts directly.
crockfordBase32 in mask.ts is exported and shared with celleditor/generate.ts, replacing its identical toCrockford; encodeUlidTime stays local because its left-padding is a different operation.
The workspace-tab-to-repo-id ternary and no-repository message are centralized as repoIdOfTab and NO_REPOSITORY_MESSAGE in state/workspace.ts, used by RepoGraphView, RepoDiffView, RepoFileView and RepoMultiDiffView.
ServerAppInitResult is exported once from git-ipc's contract.ts instead of being declared locally in extension.ts, proxyHandlers.ts and hostHandlers.ts.
A generic SettingsPaneProps<S> lives beside SettingsShell.vue, and each app instantiates it with its own SettingsSections, replacing identical per-app interfaces in workbench/settings/types.ts.
The JSON and shell scanner cursor, whitespace skipping, parse and beautify code is shared in rawTree.ts as Cursor, skipWs, tryParse, BeautifyMode, BeautifyResult and beautifyWith, replacing copies in beautify.ts and ejson.ts.
Fix fresh lint:dead (knip) findings on the spot, not later, per the repo's standing rule; e.g. make unused exports such as qualifiedNameFor, renderIndented and renderCompact module-private.
After P118, lint:dead shows 7 duplicate-export findings (6 before); the extra one is the intentional buildReviewRowMenu/buildReadOnlyRowMenu alias, matching the plan's "one body" verification grep.

### v1.9 P119 Kira Space release feed and update notifier
Kira Space has no update-available status-bar notifier, unlike Kira Studio's UpdateService/useAppUpdateStore; wiring it before Space is released would ship dead code.
The release job in .github/workflows/release.yml originally built, stamped and published only Studio's DMG on v*.*.* tags, so Space's packaging checks in scripts/verify-packaging.sh never ran.
apps/kira-space/build/config.yml keeps version "0.0.0" as the dev sentinel, so appupdate.isReleaseBuild is always false for Space.
appupdate.Checker hard-coded Studio's own releases/latest URL even for a stamped build.
Decision: one shared v*.*.* tag builds and releases both Kira Studio and Kira Space together under one release, with identical versions; there is no per-app tag scheme.
The release job's version-stamping step must also rewrite apps/kira-space/build/config.yml's version from the tag, alongside the existing stamps of apps/kira-studio/build/config.yml and apps/kira-space-vscode/package.json.
Changes to .github/workflows/release.yml are delivered via docs/pending-changes/, the same .github/workflows/ push-scope workaround P116 used.
The release job must run bun run package:space after stamping, then verify, codesign and mount-check apps/kira-space/bin/Kira Space.app and its .dmg the way Studio's are asserted.
scripts/verify-packaging.sh already carries Space-side A1/A3/A5/A6/N2/A4/N3 checks, gated on the bundle existing.
Space's disk image is named kira-space-macos-arm64.dmg (following Studio's naming convention) and is added as a second asset on the same gh release create call, so one draft release under the shared tag carries both DMGs.
internal/appupdate lives at the repo root (hoisted from Studio-only) and is parameterized only by app display name (User-Agent token) and the app's own running version.
The update checker does no asset matching or download-link validation; it only determines whether the shared release's tag is a strictly newer semver than the app's own stamped version, with identical logic for both apps.
scripts/install.sh in this public repo downloads the chosen app's DMG from the latest release, mounts it, and replaces the app in /Applications; install and update are the same command: curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vlad-cirstean/kira-studio/main/scripts/install.sh | sh -s -- --app=<studio|space>.
Each app's UpdateService shows an explicit update dialog on detecting a newer version (available vs. running version, Update and Later buttons); nothing installs without an explicit Update click.
Clicking Update spawns the install script detached (so it survives the app quitting) with the app's own name, then the app quits so the script can replace the running bundle, and the script relaunches the new version.
Dev builds (config.yml "0.0.0" sentinel) show no update dialog or status-bar affordance, as with Studio's dev builds.
Opening a direct DMG download link was rejected because a browser-downloaded DMG carries the com.apple.quarantine flag and Gatekeeper blocks it as unnotarized.
Homebrew was dropped entirely (no tap, no cask formulas, vlad-cirstean/homebrew-kira abandoned) because Cask quarantines downloads by default and its --no-quarantine option is deprecated as of Homebrew 4.7.0/5.0.0 with no replacement.
A self-hosted curl | sh install script is used because plain curl never sets the quarantine flag; release notes name this script as the only supported install method, and manual DMG-drag/Gatekeeper-workaround instructions are dropped as the primary path.
The Installer (internal/appupdate/install.go) spawns scripts/install.sh detached (Setsid: true) and waits for a 'staged <tag>' line over fd 3 before the app quits, so the script can safely replace the running bundle.
The installer script is fetched from raw.githubusercontent.com/vlad-cirstean/kira-studio/main/scripts/install.sh, the only sanctioned occurrence of that host across apps/, packages/, internal/, enforced by verify-packaging check S11.
scripts/install.sh is POSIX sh with contract marker '# kira-install-contract: 1' on line 2, kept in sync with the Go side by S11's grep.
Both Kira apps' UpdateService (Status/InstallUpdate/CancelInstall) share one createAppUpdateStore (TanStack Query for polling and install mutation, VueUse useLocalStorage for per-version dismissal shared across windows) and one UpdateDialog/UpdateAvailableItem pair.
Kira Studio's OpenReleasePage/Browser/release-URL-validation path was removed entirely, replaced by the click-to-install dialog.
The release workflow patch docs/pending-changes/.github__workflows__release.yml.patch stages one release job that builds, stamps and releases both apps' DMGs under one shared tag, with release notes naming the curl installer as the supported install path.
scripts/verify-packaging.sh added check S11 (installer/contract pin) and rescoped S10 from apps/ packages/ to apps/ packages/ internal/.
The P119 plan chose a single sequential implementer because the install script and Installer share a live hand-off contract, an ordering dependency rather than independent work.
Whether an ad-hoc-signed self-replacing install triggers an 'App Management' TCC prompt on macOS is unverified.

### v1.9 P120 Audit and remove leftover git-related surface from Kira Studio
Kira Studio is a database/API client with no git module; it had accreted git-shaped surface from the shared app base it split from (P100 per-app split, P103 shared packages/workbench and internal/shell).
Git settings (inlineBlame, dateFormat, gitLogLevel, protectedBranches, fetchAutoIntervalMinutes, gitPath, graphFontSize) and LinkService live only in Kira Space, not Kira Studio; Space keys, defaults, UI and wire shape are byte-identical to before. They moved from internal/appsettings to apps/kira-space/internal/storage/model/settings.go with identical JSON tags.
internal/appsettings.AdvancedCore and its Read/UpsertGit methods are deleted, as are GitSettings, InlineBlame and DateFormat from the shared layer, because AdvancedCore forced Studio's log-level leaf to share a JSON key with Space's git log level; each app now owns a plain LogLevel field directly.
Studio's settings leaf was renamed advanced.gitLogLevel to advanced.logLevel via migration 0028_p120_drop_git_settings.sql, which also deletes leftover git.* and appearance.inlineBlame/appearance.dateFormat rows from pre-P120 installs and carries the log-level value through.
GitLogLevelField.vue was generalized to LogLevelField.vue, parameterized by leaf key, because the two apps' markup was already byte-identical.
Dead IPC surface was removed from Studio: ChannelCodeSearch, CodeWorkspaceService mocks, codeSearch/quickOpen channels, and the vsix tombstone in the darwin Taskfile; the LinkService/OpenExternal binding had no real Studio caller.
linkOpenExternal appears 0 times in packages and apps/kira-studio and 3 times in apps/kira-space/frontend/src: the definition, the hostHandlers.ts caller, and a comment in bridge/index.ts explaining the P120 move.
docs/ARCHITECTURE.md no longer lists LinkService under Studio and drops the git-settings known-open-item.
Remaining git-word comments in apps/kira-studio are intentional: they explain coincidental substrings (buildinfo.go's github.com module path, datagrip's "DataGrip" mention).
TerminalTabState's shared shape (@shared/domain/tabs, also used by Kira Space) keeps codeRepoId even though Studio never passes it.
P120's settings-schema moves are order-dependent, so it used one sequential implementer: commit 2 compiles only once commit 1 removed Studio's Git consumer, and commit 3 is breaking for Studio's wire shape only.
P120 acceptance requires a committed inventory (file:line, verdict, disposition) of git-related hits in Studio, every real leftover removed, and both apps still building, typechecking and passing existing suites; plan is docs/v1.9/plans/P120-studio-git-audit.md.
The test:ui:studio 'ui-timing' project is skipped whenever the 'ui' project has a failure, because playwright.config.ts declares dependencies: ['ui'].

### v1.9 P121 Tab-strip elements: sizing, corners and spacing inconsistent with the rest of the UI, both apps
ToggleGroupItem corner/border rules must key on reka's data-orientation attribute, never Base UI's data-horizontal/data-vertical, because reka never emits those and such selectors are dead.
The Toggle component uses the control-tier radius rounded-kira-sm (not rounded-kira) and has a kira-lg size (26px height, 11px text) matching tab-strip density.
A default-variant ToggleGroup spaces its chips 2px apart; an outline-variant group stays connected with 4px outer corners and one divider.
ConnectionDialog's Fields/URI toggle and its three MCP read/write/DDL toggles use the kira-lg size, matching the dialog's control density.
All tab chips must call tabChipVariants, the single tab-chip class definition shipped by the UI/tabs shadcn-vue set (Tabs, TabsList, TabsTrigger, TabsContent), instead of pasting hand-rolled classes.
ConnectionDialog's detail tabs use real Tabs/TabsTrigger/TabsContent, gaining hover and arrow-key roving focus from reka's Tabs.
TabStrip.vue (both apps), ConsoleView result chips and TitleBar mode tabs call tabChipVariants directly rather than using Tabs, because they are closable/draggable/panel-less and not a Tabs fit.
TabStrip.vue's pt-0.5 top offset was the root cause of every document tab sitting 2px off-centre in its 34px bar; it was removed so the active tab centres exactly.
Kira Space's GitPanel header must not apply its own text styling to its nested top-level tabs.
scripts/check-theme-classes.sh guards against toggle data-horizontal/vertical selectors, hand-rolled tab-chip class prefixes, and rounded-kira in UI/toggle* files.
P121 tab-strip sizing, corners and spacing were likely a P110 Tailwind-migration-era gap, and Studio and Space may each have their own tab-strip copy after P100's split.
The orchestrating session must sequence P121, P122 and P123 rather than run them concurrently, because they have real file-overlap risk in shared theme tokens (packages/workbench or packages/theme).
P121 changed chip and toggle radius from 6px to 4px, and the default-group chip gap from 0 to 2px.
P121 changed dialog toggles (S5/S6) from height 22px to 26px and font-size 10px to 11px.
P121 fixed document-tab vertical centring offset from 2px to 0px (T1, both apps) and GitPanel tab letter-spacing from 0.55px to normal (S1).
Every hand-rolled tab/toggle instance funnels through the same one or two shared primitives (tabChipVariants, and the ToggleGroup/Toggle fix), so a representative instance per primitive proves the other callers moved the same way.
Studio never renders a tab-strip-new button, because WorkbenchShell.vue gates it to Terminal mode via showNewTab; in Kira Space the "New terminal" button is always visible.
budgets.spec.ts:356 is a strict wall-clock latency budget test (e.g. p50 scroll budget ≤12ms); its source comment says its flakiness is cross-file worker contention, which no in-file serialization mode addresses.
Visual baseline diffs after P121 were confined to named S/T instances (connection-dialog, console, data-view, http-request-view, settings).

### v1.9 P122 Focus-ring border too thick on every element that shows one, both apps
The shared focus ring is defined once as @utility focus-ring in packages/theme/src/base.css: a 1px --kira-focus outline with -1px offset. The SQL-view filter input is the reference for this value, and P122 left that value unchanged.
A base-layer :focus-visible { @apply focus-ring; } rule applies the shared focus ring to every natively focused element.
P122 changed the focus ring from the old ring-3 / ring-focus/50 halo to a 1px outline. Input, Textarea, Button, Toggle and Checkbox no longer draw their own halo and inherit the base rule. Button's destructive variant uses focus-visible:outline-error instead of a ring.
InputGroupInput and InputGroupTextarea opt out of the focus ring with outline-none because their ancestor InputGroup draws it via has-[...:focus-visible]:focus-ring. NativeSelect and InputGroup's kira variant use the same focus-ring utility.
In packages/theme/src, focus-ring is used in input-group/index.ts twice: the default variant's has-[...]:focus-ring and the kira variant's focus-within:focus-ring.
Studio's five hand-rolled filter/search boxes now use InputGroup variant="kira" with InputGroupInput: ConnectionDialog.vue engine search (1), BrowseView.vue (1), StreamView.vue offset and since fields (2), OperationsPanel.vue filter (1). They render the same reference ring as the SQL data-view filter, where before they had no ring.
SwatchRadio.vue keeps its 2px white focus ring by design, and the focus-width guard excludes it.
scripts/check-theme-classes.sh has a check_focus_width guard that fails on any focus*:ring-* or focus*:outline-[2-9] class. A (?<![-\w]) lookbehind excludes SwatchRadio's peer-focus-visible:outline-2, with 0 false positives at HEAD.
The check_focus_width guard's pre-phase hit count is 14 (input 2, textarea 2, input-group 2, button 4, toggle 2, checkbox 2), not the plan's estimate of 17; the plan's estimate was off, not the guard or fix.
The red aria-invalid focus halo (also 3px) was left out of P122's scope and deferred to a follow-up phase. No aria-invalid token was touched: every removed aria-invalid:* token reappears the same number of times on an added line.
Kira Space's VS Code-hosted git-ui focus styling is treated as VS Code-owned chrome, outside "both apps" for the focus-ring work, so no kv: root change was made.
In control-sizing.spec.ts, the expectFocusRing helper polls on outlineColor before asserting the rest of the style. Tailwind transition-colors/transition-all utilities on the primitives transition outline-color/-width/-offset, so a one-shot read after focus was flaky.
The 5 new control-sizing.spec.ts tests pass at HEAD; per P117's "confirm once" rule, the 4 non-reference shapes were confirmed to fail at 8f78d94e before being kept.
StreamView.vue (Kafka stream view) has no Playwright fixture anywhere in the test tree, so its filter changes could only be verified by class-string diff.
BrowseView.vue has no ui-project fixture; its filter box is covered by redis.frontend.spec.ts (ipc-frontend project, 'browse tab: filter and Up').
docs/DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md describes sandbox font drift as a uniform, whole-page signature that would show on every visual spec, so a clean full visual pass proves sandbox/baseline parity.

### v1.9 P123 Font sizes inconsistent across both apps — normalize UI chrome to a small fixed set of sizes
P123 scope is UI chrome only (labels, buttons, menus, panel headers, status bar, dialogs, tree/list rows) in both apps; data-view surfaces (SQL results grid, document/JSON viewers, diff/blame views) stay user-customizable and out of scope.
Chrome font sizes in both apps use one four-value scale: text-kira-sm/md/lg/xl (host), kv:text-sm/base/lg (git-ui/kv root), kv:text-kui-sm/base (kira-ui), driven by --kira-t-sm/md/lg/xl in packages/theme/src/tokens.css.
Scale sizes: sm for secondary/caption/status-bar text, md for default/control/body text, lg for headings, xl for hero titles only.
The md size uses the same --kira-font-size variable that Data font size's own default already used, by pre-existing P16/P22 design.
The retired xs step (10px) folds into sm everywhere in chrome.
Tailwind's stock text-xs…text-9xl scale is reset with --text-*: initial in both @theme roots: packages/theme/src/base.css and packages/git-ui/src/theme/tailwind.css.
scripts/check-theme-classes.sh has a check_font_scale check that fails if the stock Tailwind text scale or a stray xs chrome class returns.
Data views (SQL/document/git grids, Monaco, status-bar/tab dirty-dot glyphs) keep their own fixed or Data-font-size-tracking sizes, untouched by design; docs/ARCHITECTURE.md records this in the Styling row.
text-kira-xs remains only in the @theme entry in packages/theme/src/base.css, AppearancePane.vue (2), StreamView.vue (2) and KeyValuePane.vue (1).
Changing chrome font sizes changes visual baselines for Studio specs connection-dialog, console, data-view, http-request-view, schema-dialog, settings and workbench, and for the Space settings spec.
ConnectionDialog.vue's fixed height was bumped from h-136 (544px) to h-138 (552px) because the MCP tab content overflowed by 6px (scrollHeight 462 vs clientHeight 456) once its labels moved from sm/xs to md.
connection-dialog-tabs.spec.ts has a "the dialog's box never moves" test that catches ConnectionDialog height overflow.
The earlier P104 change also bumped the ConnectionDialog MCP tab height, from 520 to 544, which is the precedent for the h-138 bump.
Fix a failing test on the spot, even when it is outside the current scope (CLAUDE.md rule); the ConnectionDialog height regression was fixed in an extra commit.
P123 visual re-recordings are committed one per diffing spec (7 Studio + 1 Space), not as a single commit, so each spec's diff review stays legible in history, following P122's per-shape commit granularity.
The P123 runtime probe's key/value and stream grid coverage is source-level proof only (anchor script plus token-chain diff) because no existing test harness exposes their redis fixture protocol.
Git conflict resolution during landing/rebase is orchestration-level work, not a subagent's.
When rebasing P123 onto P121, keep P121's structure and apply P123's §1.2 text-size fix to the resulting class string.
packages/theme/src/components/ui/tabs/index.ts (tabChipVariants) is a P121-only file that P123 never touches, so a rebase carries its text-kira-sm through without conflict; it was fixed to text-kira-md (control-text role), raising every tab chip from 11px to 12px.
After rebasing P123, run rg -n 'text-kira-(xs|sm)' packages/theme/src/components/ui/tabs to catch leftover small text classes that cause no merge conflict.
Tab chips render at 12px, so the control-sizing.spec.ts assertions for P121's S5/S6 and T4 tests expect 12px instead of 11px.
Tab chips appear in five visual baselines: connection-dialog, console, data-view, schema-dialog and workbench.
Resolve binary snapshot conflicts during rebase by keeping one side as a placeholder and regenerating with test:visual:update:studio / :space against the fully merged tree, not by hand-merging.

### v1.9 P124 Kira Space commit-details "Show more" button non-functional
The commit-details "Show more" bug in Kira Space came from the Go server's commit.detail sending null instead of [] for decoration (commit with no ref), parents (root commit) and trailers (no trailers).
porcelain.parseDecoration, parseParents and ParseTrailerBlock return nil for "none", and encoding/json marshals a nil slice as null, which violates the wire contract that declares decoration, parents and trailers as non-null arrays.
In CommitMeta.vue, hasDetails reads props.detail?.decoration.length only once expanded flips, so a null decoration threw a TypeError on click and Vue aborted the patch, leaving the label at "Show more"; commits with a ref expanded fine.
A root commit's parents: null also threw in FileTree.vue, so its file tree never rendered.
The fix is server-side: gitsession/queries.go wraps Parents, Trailers and Decoration in a generic nonNil helper (incremental.go), which replaced the package's per-type nonNilRanges and nonNilUpdates, so both hosts (desktop and VS Code extension) are covered.
The regression test is a raw-JSON assertion in TestIntegration_CommitDetailAndFileTree (gitsock/detail_test.go) that a root commit's parents, trailers and decoration are [] rather than null.
Only a raw-JSON check at the server layer can catch the null-vs-[] bug, because a Go struct decode cannot tell null from [] and mocked UI payloads cannot exercise the server; so no UI spec was added.
Hand-written UI fixtures did not reproduce the bug because every existing fixture types decoration: []; reproduction required replaying the real server's commit.detail JSON captured over a real socket (gitsock detail fixture) through tests/ui's mock.

### v1.9 P125 Rewrite root `README.md` as user-facing entry point: features, status, install
The root README.md is a user-facing entry point (what Kira Studio is, features, status, install/run) and points to apps/kira-space/README.md for the sibling app.
Deep reference material (full per-engine matrix, every script, chapter history) is not duplicated in the root README; it links out to docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md, docs/PACKAGING.md and docs/v1.9/.
Check every feature, status or version claim in the README against current source; never copy it.
The README stays normal prose under CLAUDE.md's exemption.
Requirements and Development sections are kept in the root README because apps/kira-space/README.md cites both.
The README dropped the claim "SSH tunneling (planned for v2)" because no spec backs it.
<!-- /chapter v1.9 -->

<!-- chapter v2.0 -->
## v2.0
Source: docs/v2.0/ at bd0c224688d9. 89 phases.
The v2.0 chapter continues the running P sequence from P126; v1.9 covered P96-P125.
P127-P129 shift Claude Code agent work from Kira Studio to Kira Space in three phases: agent-activity monitoring extracted into a shared package (P127), a module system for Kira Space with a terminal module both apps share (P128), and Kira Space's ade module (P129).
Kira Space's ade module is an agent merge queue across git worktrees (P129).
P126 is a Kira Space data-font-size bug fix.
P130-P133 came from four user requests: a focus-ring colour flash on inputs (P130), the git graph and review view moved onto shadcn-vue (P131), the Operations panel extracted, fixed to span full width and brought to Kira Space (P132), and custom-script configuration moved from Settings into the terminal module (P133).
Use the running P numbering (P126+) for new work instead of a fresh letter, per CLAUDE.md's one-running-sequence rule.

### v2.0 P126 Kira Space "Data font size" renders much smaller than set — find the cause live, then fix it
Static tracing of the Kira Space Data font size pipeline (settings domain, applyAppearance(), tokens.css --kira-font-size/--kira-t-* scale, Monaco/xterm/git-ui consumers) found it unit-correct: px throughout, no rem/em, no zoom/transform, no divide/multiply.
P123 intentionally splits chrome vs data text roles by 1-2px, which is too small to explain the reported 'much smaller' Data font size rendering in Kira Space.
P126 acceptance: record root cause plus before/after computed-style evidence; the affected node must compute to the configured size after the fix; a test:ui:space assertion on computed font size must guard it, shaped like Kira Studio's tests/ui/control-sizing.spec.ts.
Fix the cause found by a live runtime check (getComputedStyle and cascade walk in a running Kira Space), never an assumed cause.
The dead xs class was removed from StatusBar.vue because no built CSS chunk in either app's frontend/dist defines a .xs rule; the node still computes 11px from its parent's text-kira-sm.
For a Kira Space real backend in a sandbox, build with go build -tags server and seed windows('main') plus a code_repos row before loading /?window=main, otherwise internal/appstorage/tabs.go:117 fails with 'unknown window: main'.
Git discovery in Kira Space is darwin-only (apps/kira-space/internal/gitclient/discovery.go), so exercising real git in the sandbox recipe needs a local-only, never-committed Locate patch.
Live measurement in a Linux sandbox (Go server-mode backend, WebKit and Chromium) showed every text node computing exactly the configured Data font size, none below 11px, applied live with no stale value, so no defect was found there.
Reading source for macOS-only layers (WKWebView zoom clamps, -apple-system vs Menlo face, git.graphFontSize override) found no defect.
The P126 root cause is still open; it is blocked on plan §4's live measurement on a real macOS host (inspectable dev:space or devtools-tagged build, Safari Develop console script, sqlite3 read of ~/.kira-space/kira.db).
The §5 fix and the test:ui:space guard spec for P126 are gated on §4's macOS measurement output existing first.
Phase numbering continues the single running sequence (P126+) rather than taking a fresh letter, per CLAUDE.md's one-running-sequence rule.

### v2.0 P127 Extract agent-activity monitoring into a shared package; Kira Studio stops consuming it
The Claude Code agent-activity hook listener lives in shared repo-root internal/agenthooks, a host-neutral Go package (Manager, Event, socket protocol) importable from either app and importing nothing from apps/.
agenthooks.Manager provides start/stop/status and ComposeLaunch, which builds the --settings flag and hook env; New quotes the settings path once so ComposeLaunch has no error path.
The agent-activity reducer (agentActivity.ts) and store factory (createAgentSessionsStore.ts) live in packages/workbench/src/state/; the reducer spec moved with the reducer.
A biome.json rule bans @bindings* imports from packages/workbench, so the shared TS package stays free of host bindings.
Agent wire types (AgentSession, AgentEvent, AgentPhase, AgentActivity) stay in packages/shared/domain/agent.ts, already shared since P86.
The agent-sessions event channel strings are hoisted to internal/appevent, with one Go copy (internal/appevent/appevent.go) and one TS copy (packages/shared/protocol/events.ts).
The agent reducer's Stop event clears toolName as well, per P86 §13 rule 4 ("clears everything"); this fixed a pre-existing bug.
Kira Studio no longer consumes agent monitoring: its StatusBar agent widget, ClaudeCodePane hooks toggle, tab-attention badge, TerminalView hooks banner, agentHooks/agentSessions state, bridge/agenthooks.go and TerminalService.AgentHooks were removed (bound services 28 → 27).
The claudeCode.hooksEnabled and hooksPromptDismissed settings were removed from Go and TS settings schemas; migration 0029 deletes both rows from an existing settings table.
Studio's keep-awake agent reason (ClaudeCode.KeepAwakeWithAgents, KeepAwakeAgentSessionsChanged) is kept; it reads only the terminal registry's agent count (OpenParams.Agent) in internal/terminal, never the hook session monitor.
The shared agent-monitor package is not wired into any app's UI; P129 wires it into Kira Space's ade module.
Repo-root internal/ sits outside both apps' layering_test.go scopes.
Both apps' tsconfig.tests.json exclude ../../packages/workbench/src/**/*.spec.ts, because the moved reducer spec is a bun:test file under a types: ["node"] project.

### v2.0 P128 Kira Space module system; terminal module shared by both apps; `ade` slot registered
Kira Space has its own mode union and MODES registry; ModeDef and the mode-switch plumbing are hoisted to packages/workbench so both apps share them without special-casing.
Adding a module must take one registry entry, its panel/start components, and a Go-side transport only if needed; never add scattered per-module branches through either app.
The terminal module is extracted once into a shared package used by Kira Studio and Kira Space, not re-implemented per app; the Go PTY layer lives at repo-root internal/terminal.
TerminalPanel's Studio-only custom-scripts coupling (state/customScripts, P85) is now an optional injected seam (scripts on TerminalModuleContext), injected only by Studio's workbench/terminalModule.ts.
The ade slot is a placeholder registry entry (label, icon, empty-state panel/start) with no functionality; it touches only the registry and its own components (AdePanel.vue/AdeStart.vue, no Go, store or bridge). P129 needs it.
P128 starts only after P127 lands, because P127 removes the AgentHooks (P86) difference between the two terminal bridges.
Repo-root internal/terminal.BoundService and internal/windowsvc.Service carry the single bound method set each; both apps' bridge.TerminalService and bridge.WindowsService are one-line embeddings that keep each app's own FQN.
Window mode read/write (WindowModes, GetMode, SetMode) lives in internal/appstorage/window.go; Kira Space persists per-window mode in windows.mode via migration 0003.
Mode SQL lives in one place: internal/appstorage/window.go (GetMode/SetMode), plus Studio's List column list that selects the mode column.
createModeStore's default type parameter must be Record<never, never>, not Record<string, never>, because an index signature of never spread last in the return object makes every key (hydrateMode, setMode, active) resolve to never.
createModeStore takes positional arguments (control, defaultMode, extend); extend is required even when a caller has nothing to add (Kira Space passes () => ({})), because leaving it optional/uninferred broke Pinia's action/state extraction for the whole store.
Kira Space has three registered modules: git (existing workspace, unchanged), terminal (shared components, no scripts seam), and ade (placeholder); visibleWorkspace() is the one function reading across the mode and workspace stores.
visibleWorkspace() is the one reader that sees module keys; its single git-mode check is the only permitted per-module branch. The ade module is isolated to workbench/modes.ts.
In Kira Space, openRepoWorkspace forces the mode to git, but activateWorkspace deliberately does not, because boot-time fall-forward onto a restored repo must honour the mode windowsEnsure persisted; forcing git would snap a relaunch in terminal/ade mode back to git, defeating per-window mode persistence.
activateWorkspace's callers are already git-mode-only UI (GitPanel row click, closeRepoWorkspace fallback) or the boot-time fall-forward in main.ts.
Kira Space's views/repo/RepoTerminalView.vue was deleted; its terminal tab folds into the shared terminal module (tabViews.ts points to TerminalTabView).
TerminalTabRecord (state/tabDomain.ts) was removed from both apps because TerminalTabView.vue types its tab prop against TerminalHostView's own shape, leaving the type unused (lint:dead).
packages/workbench holds the shared mode system (modes.ts, state/createModeStore.ts, components ModeSwitcher and TabStripNewButton) and the shared terminal module (terminal/module.ts, TerminalPanel, TerminalStart, TerminalNewTab, TerminalTabView beside TerminalHostView).
In Kira Space, SpaceMode lives in its own zero-import file state/modeDomain.ts, because bridge/index.ts's createCoreControl<…, SpaceMode> call needs the type without importing state/mode.ts (which imports control from bridge/index.ts).
Non-bridge importers in Kira Space keep reading SpaceMode from state/mode.ts via its re-export of modeDomain.ts.
Wails FQN is package path + type + promoted method name, so a source-level diff of Go bound-method receivers proves the same fact as a generated-bindings diff.
After P128, Space's WindowsService has Ensure, OpenNew and SetMode (previously only OpenNew); Studio's TerminalService (Shutdown/DefaultCwd/Open/Write/Resize/Close) and WindowsService (Ensure/SetMode/OpenNew) are unchanged.
Both apps' TerminalPanel-*.js chunks still split on their own in the build.
Kira Space's bound-service count is 13 (grep -c application.NewService apps/kira-space/main.go); P116 G6 added WindowsService and P128 added no new services, only two methods to WindowsService.
The shared agent-monitoring package extracted in P127 is still unwired from Kira Space's UI; P129 wires it into the ade module, which P128 only placeholders.

### v2.0 P129 Part 1 `ade` agent runtime — Kira Space spawns and tracks Claude Code sessions
Kira Space spawns claude through the shared terminal module (renderer-driven, one spawn path), not a parallel spawn path.
internal/terminal.BoundService has an optional ComposeAgent func(terminalID, command string) (string, []string, error) seam that appends P127's hooks and the prompt; Open calls it only when agent is true and ComposeAgent is non-nil.
After composing, terminal Open rechecks MaxCommandBytes and passes the returned env into OpenParams.
Kira Studio's own BoundService leaves ComposeAgent nil, so Kira Studio behavior is unchanged.
agenthooks.Manager is always on in Kira Space, and UserPromptSubmit is hooked (added to hookEvents).
UserPromptSubmit is a real Claude Code hook_event_name, and idle_prompt and auth_success are real Notification message types, confirmed against Claude Code's hooks reference.
Kira Space persists every session it starts in the ade_sessions table (migration 0004_p129_ade_sessions.sql) with running/stopped status, and a CHECK enforcing exactly one of branch/new_work_id.
The Claude session id is chosen up front via --session-id, and sessions are resumed via --resume; last active time is tracked.
AdeService (bridge/ade.go) exposes AgentSessions, Sessions, PrepareLaunch and Send; Send writes to the agent via bracketed paste followed by enter and is refused when the session is not running.
Tracker behavior: resume of a running, foreign-repo or unknown record is refused; resume reuses the recorded cwd and Claude session id; SessionStart with a new id updates claude_session_id; events from an unknown terminal are ignored; Recover stops leftover running sessions.
The Tracker's Reconcile has a grace window to guard the race where an agent has not yet registered, handling live, past-grace and never-registered cases.
Bridge channels ChannelAgentSessions, ChannelAgentEvent and ChannelAdeSessions (kira:ade:sessions) are emitted for agent session state.
AgentActivity gains wakeArmed and at; reduceAgentActivity(prev, event, now) takes an injected clock; PreToolUse's WAKE_TOOLS is a sticky OR. The reducer also gains a waiting phase, armed by Monitor/ScheduleWakeup.
In the reducer, PostToolUse clears attention, Notification idle_prompt/auth_success leave phase and message unchanged, and Stop yields waiting when a wake is armed.
The idle_prompt/auth_success reducer rule leaves message unchanged too, because overwriting message with text that was not a request for input would contradict the rationale for leaving phase alone.
Wake-arming via Bash-background is a known limitation of the waiting-on-monitor detection, recorded under Known open items in ARCHITECTURE.
The repo's gocognit threshold is 30; main.go's ade wiring was extracted into plain top-level helpers wireAde/shutdownAde, the same shape wireGit uses, rather than inline closures with error branches.
CLAUDE.md's working agreement requires fixing lint:go findings on the spot.
Kira Space has 14 bound services (up from 13) after P129 Part 1.
P129 adapts the mock's visual style to Kira Space's theme (packages/theme tokens, shadcn-vue components) but follows docs/v2.0/design/mockup.html exactly for markup structure, data model, interaction logic and behavior; git operations reuse Kira Space's existing git session/worktree layer.
TrackerDeps.ClaudeBin defaults to "claude" in production and is unused unless a test sets it; it exists so tests can point at a fake claude script.
The sandbox login-shell PATH always resolves a bare claude to the real installed CLI ahead of anything a test could prepend, because every /etc/profile.d/*.sh script re-prepends its own bin dir, so a fake claude first on PATH is unachievable without ClaudeBin.
AdeService embeds Deps appcore.Deps, following the codebase-wide convention of bound services (as in gitclientsvc.go); it is needed for Repos.CodeRepos.Get validation and Events.Emit.
sessionId has two meanings by design: PrepareLaunch returns the Claude session id, while Send takes the ade_sessions record id. The record id never changes, whereas the Claude session id can change (e.g. /clear), so Send is keyed on the record id.
AdeSessionsChanged is broadcast to every window via Events.Broadcast (like ChannelKeepAwake), not to the focused window, because it is a payload-free process-wide invalidation signal that each window's query should refetch on.
apps/kira-space/internal has a TestDomainPackagesDoNotImportBridge layering test; internal/ade is in its checked set and the exemption list is unchanged.
Space bindings gain adeservice.ts exposing exactly AgentSessions, PrepareLaunch, Send and Sessions.
Tests for repo CRUD, wire structs and AgentSessions() were deliberately not added because they are pass-throughs. The phase tests are 14 cases in internal/ade/tracker_test.go, 2 in command_test.go, a bridge integration test, and 5 new reducer-spec cases.
TestAdeService_SpawnTrackAndExit proves the PrepareLaunch -> Open -> SessionStart (running) -> exit -> Reconcile (stopped) flow using a fake-CLI shim. The shim drives the same curl invocation as the real hook shim (buildShim in internal/agenthooks/shim.go) against the real HTTP listener.
Kira Space's server-mode binary (go build -tags server) registers AdeService. AdeService.PrepareLaunch with an unknown codeRepoId returns E_INVALID with message "codeRepoId does not exist" through the real IPC error mapping.

### v2.0 P129 Part 2 `ade` queue backend — persistence and git facts
In the ade queue, an item id is a branch's own short name, or nw:<uuid> for new work with no branch yet; git bans ':' in ref names, so the two id spaces never collide.
ade queue storage uses migration 0005_p129_ade_queue.sql with tables ade_branches, ade_new_work, ade_plan and ade_colors, accessed through AdeQueueRepo.
The settings.ade section persists Part 3's queue-board UI prefs (panelWidth, allAgentsFilter, horizonDays, historyDays, extraDays, offDays, workWeekendDays, workdayHours, spanDayShare) across relaunch; no UI reads them yet. They are served as Space settings leaves under ade.*.
Queue branch facts come from one git for-each-ref over refs/heads and refs/remotes (refname, tip, committer date, author identity, worktree path, upstream tracking), implemented in porcelain/inventory.go.
InventoryFormat must use %(authoremail:trim), not %(authoremail), because the raw form includes angle brackets, so every isMine comparison against git config user.email fails and branches are misclassified as review.
The ade facts engine (ade/facts.go) is pure functions over plain inputs with no git, DB or bridge: inferParents (four-rule parent inference with cycle guard), pairFacts (conflict/share pair table), mergedRule, rebindCandidates, colorSlot, atRisk.
ade.Queue holds a per-repo gitsession.Conn, uses a per-repo mutex to serialize Snapshot's rebind step, writes, Refresh, ForcePush and Archive, and debounces repo-changed by 250ms per repo before OnRepoChanged fires.
Snapshot computes per-branch facts via errgroup limited to 4 concurrent.
Refresh fetches, re-snapshots, and cross-checks ResolveBranchPr for "mine" branches not yet git-merged. It recomputes merge/history facts via the same snapshotLocked path as Snapshot (ancestor-based MarkFacts), so the two cannot drift apart.
ForcePush runs git push with --force-with-lease --force-if-includes per branch, through RunRemote.
Archive runs the worktree-remove preflight, stops linked running sessions, then removes the worktree; the at-risk check covers uncommitted files and commits not in main.
Conflicts, shares and behind are computed with git merge-tree --write-tree plus changed-path sets (requires git >= 2.38); go-git was declined.
User decision: ready and ciFailing are not computed at all; both are dropped from the data model, as are Jira title/status. PR state surfaces only as ResolveBranchPr's raw state (open/draft/merged/closed) and title, with no derived flags.
Jira data is plain storage only: a key plus pasted URL (JiraKey, JiraURL), stored, wired and validated, with no title, status, live-sync or API-call field.
AdeService.Queue exposes 15 bound queue methods (RepoSnapshot, RepoPrs, CandidateBranches, AddBranch, AddNewWork, UpdateNewWork, SetBranchMeta, SetPlan, SetQueuedAfter, BindNewWork, Refresh, ForcePush, ArchiveRisk, Archive, ProvideCredential), 19 with Part 1's 4. Other Space services' FQN output stayed byte-identical.
Every AdeService queue method validates args to E_INVALID before touching the store or git, and maps repos.ErrQueued and repos.ErrArchived to E_INVALID.
Bridge channels kira:ade:repo (AdeRepoChanged, debounced per-repo change signal) and kira:ade:credential (AdeCredentialRequested, delivered to the focused window) carry ade queue events.
ade uses its own gitsession.Conn, separate from the git module's per-window streaming Conns but wired to the same Askpass broker, the same pattern gitrpc's remote-op handler uses.
Known open limitations, recorded in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md: rename/delete conflicts are not handled in conflict computation (§0.7), and linked-worktree dirty state is not watched, refreshing only on snapshot.
Do not export the ADE_*_RANGE/ADE_DATE_LIST_MAX constants in settingsDomain.ts, because only the file's own zod schema uses them and knip's unused-exports rule fails otherwise.
QueueDeps has OnSessionsChanged and AutofetchMinutes fields beyond the plan's §5.1 sketch, because the §6.4 rebind needs an AdeSessionsChanged signal when it moves session rows and AdeRepoSnapshot.AutofetchMinutes must echo the global git.fetchAutoIntervalMinutes.
Autofetch maps to the global git.fetchAutoIntervalMinutes leaf (model.GitSettings, 0 = off), not a per-repo interval. Design UiPrefs.autofetch is a boolean view over it (> 0); no new leaf was added.
lastFetchAt is the mtime of <CommonDir>/FETCH_HEAD, which covers fetches by Claude, autofetch and the git module alike.
reconcileNewWork returns ambiguous rebind candidates so NewWorkFact.BranchCandidates is populated when a new-work item's agent leaves more than one candidate branch behind.
AdeJiraPatch uses nested key/url on the wire, matching the read side's nested Jira field, rather than the store's flat JiraKey/JiraURL pointers. AdeNewWorkPatchArgs and AdeBranchMetaPatchArgs toModel() map it back to the flat model patch.
SetQueuedAfter validates 'after' as a general item id (non-empty, bounded, no NUL/newline), not the stricter branch-ref rule, because new-work item ids are nw:<uuid> and the branch-ref rule bans ':'.
On the wire, AdeBranchWire.Base uses "" to mean main (parent item id), not the design doc's 'main' string sentinel.
TestDomainPackagesDoNotImportBridge, Space's layering test in layering_test.go, includes internal/ade with the exemption list unchanged.
internal/ade has queue_test.go with 10 cases: conflict/share pairs, mine×review conflict, stack parent inference, file deltas/dirty codes, merged detection via Refresh, Refresh fetch and rerun facts, force push with lease rejection, archive clean/dirty/discard, rebind, and a -race concurrent Snapshot×8 with Refresh and SetPlan.
facts_test.go covers the conflict/share computation and the SPEC row's interacting rules as table tests over plain inputs, with no git or DB. No tests exist for repo CRUD, wrappers, settings leaves, or validation helpers, per the plan.
The pair rule finds no pair for two branches touching different files (§0.7 shared-path rule).
RepoPrs returns kind "disabled" when no gh auth is configured.
The ade package has exactly three git mutation call sites (RunRemote/RunOp): fetch, forcePush, and worktreeRemove. It builds no git argv for merge-tree, for-each-ref, log or status, and uses no go-git.
When auditing for derived PR flags, anchor the regex on word boundaries, because unanchored 'ready' matches 'already' and gives false positives.
This phase's only renderer change is settingsDomain.ts in apps/kira-space/frontend/src (the ade.* settings leaves); no renderer feature code was added.
Branch.sessions is Part 1's Sessions(), joined by branch in Part 3's useQueue. Session activity is a Part 3 reducer concern; Session id/state/lastActive/worktree come from Part 1's AdeSessionWire.
archivedAt moves to AdeHistoryItem.ArchivedAt once a branch is archived, rather than staying on the active-branch row.
PR data is served as a separate RepoPrs.Branches map keyed by branch, as ResolveBranchPr's raw state, not nested per branch.
UserMeta's names/links/est/notes are folded directly into AdeBranchWire's name/draftTitle/jira/prUrl/est/notes fields instead of a separate side-table.
AdeCandidateBranch adds a remoteOnly field beyond the design, to distinguish remote-only candidates from local ones in the Add → Existing branch search.
AdeNewWorkWire serves id/title/jira/startFrom/notes/est/branchName, plus createdAt and branchCandidates (for the §0.10 rebind picker).
RepoPlan's unpushed field is derived from git at read time, not stored, and is served as the same wire field in AdePlanWire.
ColorMap is served as AdeRepoSnapshot.Colors.
historyOpen is runtime-only: it resets per repo tab and is never persisted.
AdeRepoSnapshot adds Main, LastFetchAt and WorktreeBasePath beyond design §6, needed to compute ahead/behind/merged and the Add flow.

### v2.0 P129 Part 3 `useQueue()`, ade data layer and module shell
Work status in useQueue has no `CI failing` or `ready` rung, and titles have no Jira-title fallback; these are user decisions from the Part 1 plan §0.
ModeDef in modes.ts is a discriminated union of PanelModeDef and FullModeDef (layout: 'full'); ModeRegistry<M, D> has a second type parameter; the ade mode is a FullModeDef rendering a full-area view.
WorkbenchShellBase has an optional tabStripVisible flag that defaults to true.
Space's ade data layer uses TanStack Query over six AdeService methods, with push-driven keys (staleTime: Infinity) invalidated by push signals installed via installAdeSignals.
AdeService.Refresh resolves (never rejects) with .error set for a git-level failure such as auth or network, so the Refresh mutation must read AdeRefreshResult.error as well as the rejected error, or a failure would render as ok.
useQueue.ts is a pure port of the mockup's renderVals(); parity is tested by running the mockup itself as a node:vm oracle in ade-queue-parity.spec.ts.
Space has its own instance of P127's agent-activity store in ade/state/agentSessions.ts, and the ade bridge adds channels kira:ade:sessions, kira:ade:repo and kira:ade:credential.
The main line's behind count (behindRoots) is refetched only by that repo's own kira:ade:repo push.
lint:dead (knip) must be clean at the test-coverage step and before push, not per commit.
knip.json's apps/kira-space/frontend workspace scans only src/**/*.{ts,vue}; every app's tests/unit and tests/ui tree is excluded except apps/kira-space-vscode's own workspace block, so test-only consumers are invisible to knip.
mockupToWire.ts derives the history item type via AdeRepoSnapshot['history'] instead of importing AdeHistoryItem, so that type need not be exported, because knip cannot see test-tree consumers.
Kira Studio's modes.ts types MODES as ModeRegistry<AppMode, PanelModeDef>, a type-only change, since that app's shell reads .panel/.start unconditionally.
In ade-module.spec.ts, relative-time assertions use real Date.now() at fixture-build time instead of Playwright page.clock, because useTimeAgo's reactive tick doesn't reliably resync to a clock frozen after relaunch()'s boot completes.
In support/ipcChannels.ts, the IPC keys adeSessions and adeSessionsChanged are split because adeSessions already names the bound call (AdeService.Sessions); this follows the existing gitClientsList/gitClientsChanged split.
VueUse's UseNowOptions has no interval field, so AdeRepoView.vue computes today (local YYYY-MM-DD, recomputed every minute) with useIntervalFn and a plain ref(new Date()), following packages/workbench/src/util/usePendingDecision.ts.
AdeActivityIcon.vue's two tiny badge glyphs and AdeRepoTabs.vue's needs-input count badge use text-kira-sm (11px, the font scale's floor) instead of mockup-literal 7px/8px/11px sizes, because the literals fail P123 §6.2's font-scale lint.
civilFromDays is a from-scratch civil-calendar algorithm, not a port of a mockup helper.
The block-level Rebase action's label is the plain string 'Rebase', never 'Rebase onto X'.
QueueCell.tag is { label, tone } only with no tip, because a per-cell tag has no tooltip surface in this phase's UI; QueueTag (segment-level) does carry tip.
Part 3 renders no queue board (only repo tabs, header and main line), so the SPEC.md §9 queue-board design decisions remain live constraints for Parts 4-6.
AddBranch is a Part 4+ concern, so RepoSnapshot returns empty branches/pairs/history until a branch is queued.
Part 3 makes no Go changes; its UI consumes six methods (AdeService.Sessions, AgentSessions, RepoSnapshot, RepoPrs, Refresh, ProvideCredential) whose wire.ts TS types match the real Go JSON.
Server-mode live checks use go build -tags server and curl against /wails/runtime, as the established substitute for a GUI session, per docs/DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md.
On success, Refresh returns {"refsChanged":0,"newlyMerged":[]} with no error field.
Pixel-level visual comparison belongs to the tests/visual/* pixel-diff tier, not the ade-module UI assertions.
budgets.spec.ts timing-budget flakiness (e.g., 12ms scroll-response p50) comes from cross-file worker contention, which no in-file serialization mode addresses.

### v2.0 P129 Part 4 Claude Code dialog and archive-at-risk dialog
The Claude Code dialog has no Merge template or action, by user decision recorded in Part 1 plan §0.
The Claude Code dialog's Send forwards the message to a running session, or launches one through Part 1 if none is running.
The Claude Code dialog's force-push switch defaults to off.
The Claude Code dialog runs a busy check over every branch a rewrite touches, with live re-evaluation and a two-click Override.
The archive safety dialog (design §2.4) offers 'Just delete' and 'Send to Claude, then archive'; the latter completes on the agent's Stop.
The Claude Code dialog is wired from the main line's Rebase all, which is hidden while rebase turns are in flight and reappears once they end.
Dialog templates need short display names (main, origin/main) for the main line, so the Go ade snapshot serves short names via mainDisplay and carries a Remote field (RepoSnapshot.Remote / AdeRepoSnapshot.remote) instead of the full refname; AdeMain.name/.ref hold the short forms. Documented in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md.
sendRebaseOrQueue and sendArchive cancel their armed TurnWatch when delivery fails, so a failed delivery does not leak an unresolved watch.
useQueue.ts exports parentOf and kids; its after-rebase block action has targetIds [g.root, g.after.id] (previously [g.root], indistinguishable from a rebase-onto-main action).
lint:dead runs pre-push only and flags exports with no consumer outside their own file; unused dialog exports were un-exported accordingly.
The ade dialog's composer logic lives in dialogCompose.ts (a port of the mockup oracle), turn watching in turnWatch.ts, and send/archive flow in dialogFlow.ts; the dialog component is AdeClaudeDialog.vue.
The shadcn switch component lives in packages/theme/src/components/ui/switch and is registry-verbatim.
The Go Archive dirty-worktree rejection from checkWorktreeRemovable is a plain error routed to E_INTERNAL, the same code as every other Archive failure, so there is no E_INVALID/atRisk wire signal to branch on.
On any Archive failure, dialogFlow.ts onArchiveTurn re-fetches ArchiveRisk and branches on its fresh dirty/unmerged fields instead of the error code: still at risk means Claude left changes (reopen with fresh risk, same target choice); no risk left means a genuine other failure (actionError).
A draft "Start new work" (sendStart's draft branch in dialogFlow.ts) launches with cwd: deps.ctx.repoRoot rather than a dedicated worktree, because a not-yet-named branch has no worktree yet; the session is bound to a real branch/worktree once the agent names one.
PrepareLaunch refuses a cwd that does not exist on disk (E_INVALID), so launching only works with an already-real directory such as the repo root.
A rewrite touching more than one root's stack sends one message per root rather than one shared message (plan §0.13); this is pinned by ade-dialog-rules.spec.ts.
bun run typecheck:space-tests does not cover apps/kira-space/tests/unit/**; that is covered by typecheck:space-unit (tsgo -p apps/kira-space/tests/unit/tsconfig.json).
tsgo narrows let x: T | null = null variables to never at read sites reached only through a closure; the workaround is explicit (x as T | null) casts at those read sites.
bun run lint:dead has 7 pre-existing duplicate-export findings, none in ade/.
A real claude CLI process cannot be spawned unattended in the sandbox: first run hits an interactive workspace-trust confirmation, and --dangerously-skip-permissions is refused as root. The PrepareLaunch→Open→Stop→completion flow is therefore covered by fake-deps tests (ade-dialog-flow.spec.ts) and the mocked flow in ade-dialogs.spec.ts.
Send against an unknown session id is refused with the error "ade: session is not running" by Tracker validation.
Archive with discard:true ("Just delete") removes the linked worktree including uncommitted changes.

### v2.0 P129 Part 5 timeline, stack boxes and drag and drop
Part 5 of P129 uses a generic placeholder Claude Code icon reusing an icon the app already ships (e.g. the ade module's robot codicon from P128's modes.ts), not the branded asset design §2.5 names.
Part 5 is the first consumer of AdeService.ForcePush and useQueue's pushing input, via the action-column Force push; it moved here from Part 4 per the first-consumer rule.
In ADE drag and drop, dropping my work opens Part 4's Move dialog, while parked work applies the move directly with a single SetPlan call and no confirm step.
ADE timeline drag and drop uses vue-draggable-plus 0.6.1, added in commit 4e42afd6.
AdeAddPopover.vue must wrap its CommandItems in a CommandGroup inside CommandList, because the shadcn-vue Command family's context injection requires CommandGroupContext; without it candidate-branch rendering silently breaks with only a console injection error.
mockRuntime.ts matching: a channel with exactly one registered snapshot answers any call regardless of args; a channel with two or more requires each call's canonicalized args to exactly match one snapshot, with no FIFO fallback, so a mismatched call hangs.
The force-push confirm's token and retry args are the mocked result's own branch field, not the original request's item id (adeActions.ts forcePush uses openConfirm with token r.branch and retries forcePush(repoId,[r.branch],[r.branch])).
ade-timeline.spec.ts has 10 independent test() blocks, one per §3.4 scenario, each with its own relaunch(), fixture data and control-mock array, rather than one shared fixture.
CodeWorkspaceService.ImportRepo cannot succeed on Linux because its git discovery is macOS-only. AdeService's own git operations read the git.gitPath setting directly and bypass that Discovery gate, so they work on Linux when git.gitPath is set; live checks use a direct DB-row insert plus an explicit git.gitPath.
docs/DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md records the live-check bypass technique (direct DB row, settings.Git.GitPath, raw /wails/runtime curl) as reusable environment knowledge for later parts' live checks.
The ADE plan (SetPlan day/order) persists across a server restart.
Off days are stored in settings under ade.offDays, and SetPlan can move work off an off day to the next day.
ForcePush on a diverged branch updates the remote branch; after refetch the unpushed tag in plan.unpushed is cleared and upstreamAhead/upstreamBehind return to 0.
Archive (discard:false) moves a branch from branches into history in RepoSnapshot with an archivedAt timestamp; ArchiveRisk reports facts such as unmerged count and dirty list from actual git state.
The wheel-pull gesture that opens the ADE history view is pure frontend with no Go-side counterpart, and is covered by the "history pull" test in ade-timeline.spec.ts.
Studio UI tests (test:ui:studio) show a cross-file worker-contention flake class: different tests fail in full runs but pass in isolation.

### v2.0 P129 Part 6 detail panel
The ADE detail panel header has no Merge action, because merging is a user decision.
The detail panel is resizable, defaults to half width, and has a minimum width of 340px.
The detail panel's PR chip shows ResolveBranchPr's raw state plus its title, with no Approved/Changes requested states.
Jira in the detail panel is a plain link with no live sync (user decision): the pasted link or key is parsed to its ABC-123 key and stored with the pasted URL. A bare key has no URL and renders unlinked. There is no Jira API call, credentials, fetched title, status chip or syncing state.
The detail panel's Notes field is a TipTap WYSIWYG editor that stores its content as Markdown.
The Agents tab shows one terminal tab per running session through the shared TerminalHostView, and lists Stopped sessions with Resume.
Clicking the activity button in a stack row's agents pill selects the branch and opens that session's terminal in the Agents tab.
For new work whose agent left more than one candidate branch, the panel shows branchCandidates as a picker that calls BindNewWork.
ADE Part 6 depends on Part 5, because branch selection comes from the timeline.
The Part 6 plan is at docs/v2.0/plans/P129-part6-ade-detail-panel.md. Part 5's §6.1 live-check technique (docs/DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md) drives a real Go server built with -tags server over the /wails/runtime HTTP surface with curl.
The server rejects SettingsService.Set of ade.panelWidth below the 340 px floor (e.g. 100 gives 'E_INTERNAL: model: ade.panelWidth: invalid value 100'); the frontend clamp relies on this floor.
ade.panelWidth is durably persisted in the settings table (key ade.panelWidth); a value of 0 is the half-width default.
Branch Jira and PR paste data (jira_key, jira_url, pr_url) is persisted in the ade_branches table in SQLite.
The Branch href format https://<host>/<owner>/<repo>/tree/<branch> requires a GitHub-shaped origin remote, because githubRepo (gh.go) checks the host; RepoWebURL mirrors PrBrowserURL under the same githubEnabled/githubRepo gates.
Branch notes Markdown (headings, checklists, links) is stored byte-for-byte in the ade_branches.notes column via SetBranchMeta and read back unchanged by RepoSnapshot.
RepoWebURL has no dedicated Go test by plan decision (§0.8), since it mirrors PrBrowserURL under gates already covered by gh_test.go.
Never launch the real claude CLI via PrepareLaunch/Send from a live-check server inside a nested Claude Code session, because there is no verified separate credential path and it risks uncontrolled recursive agent invocation; real launch needs a human-supervised run.
In the sandbox, git remote set-url was denied by the permission classifier as 'Remote Repoint', even on a disposable scratch repo; live checks needing a GitHub-shaped origin must plan around it (recorded in docs/DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md).

### v2.0 P129 Part 7 All agents view; closing mockup comparison
In Kira Space ADE, the dialogFlow.ts sendStart resume branch was broken since Part 4: it sent empty branch and newWorkId (rejected by Validate's exactly-one-of check) and sent the Claude session id as resume, though Tracker.Prepare looks Resume up as the ade_sessions record id.
The All agents list is built by pure functions buildAllAgents/activitySummary in allAgents.ts: a three-way join (live queue item, archive history, orphan), grouped by repo, sorted by urgency then recency, filtered active/older.
AdeLaunch.cwd is a required field because launch.ts opens the terminal at launch.cwd (Go's effective cwd) instead of the caller's guess; UI test mocks of AdePrepareLaunch must include cwd.
The pinned All agents tab in AdeRepoTabs.vue uses a local ALL_AGENTS_TAB sentinel used only as the Tabs model value and never written to adeUi state; the filter ToggleGroup in AdeAllAgentsView.vue is persisted through settings.
cwdMissing is computed in Go: Sessions() stats each session's recorded cwd on every call and never caches it. Start's worktree-choice dialog is forced by row.archived or the session's cwdMissing.
Cross-window Open uses a FocusSession bound method and an emit chain Registry.WindowOf, shell.WindowRegistry.Focus, AdeOpenSession (CHANNEL.adeOpenSession in packages/shared/protocol/events.ts). Show/UnMinimise/Focus are already InvokeSync-wrapped in vendored Wails, so no extra sync wrapper is needed.
TerminalService.Open's Compose step refuses any command text that does not exactly match what PrepareLaunch produced.
Studio budgets.spec.ts:356 (ui-timing project) is a known flake from cross-file worker contention, documented repeatedly across earlier phase results.
Live-checking Kira Space in server mode needs a short KIRA_SPACE_HOME path under /tmp, because a long path breaks the git.sock unix-socket bind.
Server-mode Kira Space (go build -tags server) can be driven with curl over the /wails/runtime HTTP surface using WAILS_SERVER_HOST=127.0.0.1 and a free WAILS_SERVER_PORT, as documented in docs/DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md.
Sessions() reports cwdMissing true only for a session whose own worktree directory was removed, and false for other sessions, including one sharing the same branch.
PrepareLaunch with resume set to a session record id returns command "claude --resume <claude id>" and the recorded cwd, and recreates the cwd directory via os.MkdirAll if it was missing.
Archiving a branch queue item that has no separate worktree from the repo root touches no filesystem path (queue-only archive).
FocusSession returns false for a stopped session and for an unknown windowKey not in shell.WindowRegistry; the true branch (cross-window focus plus kira:ade:open-session emit) needs a real registered application window, unavailable in server mode.
In the All agents view, archived stopped sessions are labelled "stopped · archived" and show Start, never Open.
The All agents filter choice (allAgentsFilter) persists server-side via SettingsService across page loads.
Clicking Open on a running session in the All agents view leaves the pinned tab and switches to that session's repo tab in the same window.
agentSessionsStore.activity is runtime-only, populated only by hook events received while a window is connected.
ade-all-agents.spec.ts uses a primeActivity helper that drives Notification/PreToolUse/Stop events with the browser connected and asserts the exact colour/label for every activity kind.
Playwright uses webkit in this repo, matching the packaged-target convention.
The pageerror "codeworkspace: git is unavailable: notFound" is a known macOS-only-discovery limitation of CodeWorkspaceService/ImportRepo, documented in docs/DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md, not an ade defect.

### v2.0 P130 Focused input flashes a white ring before turning blue
The white ring flash on focused inputs happens because inputVariants carries transition-colors, whose Tailwind v4 list includes outline-color, so on focus outline-color animates over 150ms from its initial currentcolor (--kira-fg, near-white on dark theme) to --kira-focus.
The shared focus ring in packages/theme/src/base.css applies to every :focus-visible element as outline: var(--kira-border-width) solid var(--kira-focus); on focus outline-style flips to solid at once.
A text input matches :focus-visible on mouse click, so every click on a text input shows the ring flash.
The same transition-plus-focus-ring pairing affects Textarea, the InputGroup default variant fieldset, and on keyboard focus Button, Toggle and Checkbox.
Never animate the focus ring's colour from currentcolor; fix it once at the ring in packages/theme, not per component, so both apps inherit it.
The P130 fix is a base-layer * rule in base.css that sets outline-color, outline-width and outline-offset unconditionally (--kira-focus, --kira-border-width, calc(var(--kira-border-width) * -1)), so :focus-visible only flips the discrete outline-style, which transitions cannot interpolate.
The Button destructive variant sets outline-error on the rest state instead of under focus-visible:, so the base rule's --kira-focus does not need to be overridden on focus.
In WebKit, a text input or textarea matches :focus-visible on any script .focus() call, but a button or toggle matches only when focus arrives from a trusted OS-dispatched keyboard event; script focus and synthetic KeyboardEvents do not count.
The focus-ring.spec.ts tests in both apps reach the Button via real Tab key presses (tabUntilTestId, capped loop asserting the target is activeElement) rather than el.focus(), and fill the required postgres fields first because a disabled Save button is unreachable by Tab.
The focus-ring.spec.ts test in each app asserts focusVisible, outlineColor equal to --kira-focus (rgb(0, 120, 212)) and the outline transition list for Input and Button; before the fix outlineColor read rgb(204, 204, 204).
Textarea, InputGroup default fieldset, Button variants, InputGroupButton, TooltipIconButton, Toggle, ToggleGroupItem, Checkbox and the DialogScrollContent close button have no component-level outline override and inherit the base-layer focus ring fix.
bun run lint includes check-theme-classes.sh and check-class-conflicts.ts.
The full typecheck matrix runs tsgo/vue-tsc across eight projects and is run by the pre-commit hook.
Monaco's blinking text caret is JS-driven, so animations: 'disabled' does not suppress it. It causes small, non-reproducible red-mark diffs in test:visual:studio (seen in console.spec.ts and schema-dialog.spec.ts).
budgets.spec.ts documents that its failures come from cross-file worker contention, which no in-file serialization mode addresses.
playwright.config.ts and docs/DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md document sandbox CPU-contention timing flakes in some UI test files.
Under the pre-existing-issue exception in CLAUDE.md, log unrelated test failures in files the phase never touched (check with git diff --stat) instead of fixing them as part of the phase.

### v2.0 P131 Part 1 git-ui shadcn plumbing for both hosts; the 14 dialogs
packages/kira-ui is not a shadcn-vue wrapper: it is its own cva-plus-Floating-UI component set with no reka-ui dependency.
shadcn-vue components live in packages/theme/src/components/ui/*.
git-ui and kira-ui were excluded from P104's primitive swap because neither had a Tailwind build then; P110 A1 later gave git-ui a kv:-prefixed build but never revisited the component swap.
The kv: prefix in git-ui is a collision guard because git-ui mounts inside Kira Space's document beside Kira Space's own unprefixed root.
git-ui also renders the graph and review views in the VS Code extension's webview (apps/kira-space-vscode/src/webview/main.ts), which has no --kira-* tokens and no packages/theme Tailwind root.
tailwind-merge cannot resolve a kv: override against an unprefixed base, and git-ui call-site class overrides need to be scanned by Kira Space's Tailwind root.
The VS Code webview needs its own Tailwind root for the shadcn components plus a --vscode-* to shadcn token bridge, the reverse of packages/theme/src/vscode-bridge.css.
SlickGrid cells cannot mount a Vue component per row, so badges take shadcn badgeVariants classes and cell tooltips go through one shadcn Tooltip driven by the TooltipAnchorBridge.vue pattern from P104 (packages/workbench/src/components/TooltipAnchorBridge.vue).
KuiColumnResizeHandle has no shadcn counterpart (Resizable is a panel splitter), so it stays in git-ui; the kv: token scale stays for sizing and theming.
CommitGrid.vue holds only three KuiColumnResizeHandle uses; the rest is SlickGrid DOM with ref/PR badges built as raw elements in refBadges.ts, styled by .kv-badge* CSS, with tooltips via kira-ui's delegated data-kui-tip.
Kui* components left with no consumer are to be deleted; StreamView.vue in kira-studio and packages/workbench/src/util/floatingPosition.ts still import kira-ui.
P131 whole-phase acceptance: no Kui* import left in git-ui except KuiColumnResizeHandle; test:ui:space, test:webview and test:unit pass; graph and review shown with shadcn controls live in both Kira Space and the VS Code webview, each in its host's theme.
P131 Part 1 scope: host-neutral Tailwind core split from packages/theme/src/base.css; Kira Space root scans packages/git-ui/src; VS Code webview gets its own unprefixed root (preflight, core imported theme(inline)) plus a --kira-*-from---kv-* bridge on :root, body.
P131 Part 1 also adds an @theme alias and tsconfig paths for every git-ui compile path, pulls shadcn-vue radio-group, and adds lint guards against kv: classes on shadcn tags and unprefixed alias drift in git-ui.
P131 Part 1 moves every components/dialogs/*.vue onto Dialog/Button/Input/Textarea/Checkbox/RadioGroup/NativeSelect, raw form controls included; acceptance is no kira-ui or raw form control left in components/dialogs/ with tests green and dialogs shown live in both hosts.
The plan docs/v2.0/plans/P131-part1-foundation-and-dialogs.md holds the whole-phase plumbing (§3-§5: plumbing, call-site rules, component map) that later parts build on; §2 is the split.
P131 was split into parts because plumbing must land before any component moves, and the graph and review trees are each a full pass on their own.
If P129's ade module mounts or imports any git-ui component, never run P131 and P129 concurrently; run P131 wholly before P129 starts or after it lands, because P131 rewrites nearly every git-ui .vue file.
P131 touches packages/theme alongside P130; after P130, migrated inputs inherit the fixed ring.
P131 Part 1 was not split: plan §2 keeps Part 1 to plumbing plus dialogs, and §8 lists one sequential commit chain with no parallel streams.
packages/theme/src/tailwind-core.css is the host-neutral Tailwind entry holding every components/ui-facing @theme/@utility; base.css now only imports it plus Kira-app-only tokens, and shadcn-bridge.css's dark variant moved alongside it.
Kira Space scans git-ui sources for Tailwind via apps/kira-space/frontend/src/styles.css, imported once from main.ts.
The VS Code webview uses its own unprefixed Tailwind root (apps/kira-space-vscode/src/webview/tailwind.css, theme(inline)) and kira-bridge.css, which maps every --kira-* variable a shadcn primitive reads onto the host's --kv-* vocabulary (the reverse of vscode-bridge.css).
check-class-conflicts.ts enforces that a tag imported from @theme/components/** inside packages/git-ui/src/**/*.vue carries no kv: token.
check-theme-classes.sh's check_alias, check_focus_width and check_font_scale each run a second, kv:-excluding pass over packages/git-ui/src; it runs via bun run lint.
The shadcn-vue radio-group component was added to packages/theme/src/components/ui/radio-group/, registry-verbatim apart from the import rewrite.
All 14 git-ui dialogs plus PreflightPrediction.vue were converted onto the shadcn Dialog, Button, Input, Textarea, Checkbox, RadioGroup, NativeSelect and Label components, imported from '@theme/components/ui/...' with no wrapper layer (no defineComponent, no Git*Button-style files).
A native label wrapping a NativeSelect or Checkbox must get an explicit useId()-driven for/id pair, because biome's noLabelWithoutControl cannot see through the component's inheritAttrs: false to the native element.
RepoSettingsDialog.vue has 4 real Select usages (dateFormat, graphScope, pullStrategy, logLevel), not the 5 the plan states; the plan's count came from a grep that also matched a doc comment.
The Tailwind core split in base.css is CSS-output-identical for both apps: normalized built CSS diffed empty (Kira Space 1,498 rules, Studio 1,706 rules). Studio's differing file hashes are only declaration emission order.
DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md documents that the test:ui:space suite has timing flakes from sandbox CPU contention.
The git-ui dialogs under packages/git-ui/src/components/dialogs contain no real @kira/kira-ui import, Kui* call site, or raw input/textarea/select markup; remaining mentions are only in doc comments.
The built webview CSS (apps/kira-space-vscode/dist/ui/assets/webview-*.css) carries shadcn utilities; Tailwind v4 compiles the data-open:animate-in example to animate-in[data-open] / animate-in[data-state=open] selectors.
scripts/check-tokens.sh verifies that every webview --kira-* token resolves, via a new webview layer.
fakeGraphHost.ts mocks no preflight-gated IPC call for the 12 preflight-gated dialogs, so opening every dialog in the real running app needs a backend mock that does not exist.
In the webview, --kira-fg-muted resolves per theme from kira-bridge.css: #9d9d9d under body.vscode-dark and #606060 under body.vscode-light, matching --kv-description-fg's literals in vscode-tokens.css.
--kv-app-bg and --kv-app-fg do not vary with body.vscode-dark/light without a real VS Code host, because their var(--vscode-editor-background, …) fallback chain assumes the host supplies the live value; only tokens with a body.vscode-light literal override in vscode-tokens.css differ.
The shadcn unprefixed utilities/tokens decision for reaching both hosts is in plan §3, was implemented in commits 1-3, and is recorded in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md.
Package-wide removal of Kui* imports from git-ui (except KuiColumnResizeHandle) is deferred to Part 3; Part 1 covers only components/dialogs/, and graph/review swaps are Parts 2-3.

### v2.0 P131 Part 2 git graph onto shadcn-vue
P131 Part 2 moves packages/git-ui App.vue and every non-dialog, non-review components/*.vue (including FileTree.vue and WorktreeList.vue's dialog) off kira-ui onto shadcn-vue/reka; only KuiColumnResizeHandle (App.vue, CommitGrid.vue) remains imported from @kira/kira-ui.
git-ui owns its own helpers lib/cn.ts, lib/rowVariants.ts and lib/menuModel.ts (menuModel.test.ts moved there) instead of importing them from kira-ui.
badgeVariants lives in badgeClass.ts, a .vue-free module in packages/theme, so refBadges.ts badges can be tested with bun test. REF_BADGE_CLASS and refBadgeClass live in refBadges.ts and are used by CommitMeta, StackList and BranchPicker.
AttributeTooltip and TooltipAnchorBridge (and state/tooltip.ts) were hoisted from packages/workbench into packages/theme/src/components/; no @workbench/components/AttributeTooltip references remain. Studio's SlickGridHost.vue imports them from there.
Grid tooltips use AttributeTooltip, wired in CommitGrid, CommitMeta, FileTree and BranchPicker, and read data-kira-tip (was data-kui-tip, no longer used in git-ui).
AttributeTooltip opens on keyboard focus as well as hover.
git-ui's mount() wraps both roots in a TooltipProvider via the new MountRoot.vue.
Row context menus use DropdownMenuContent with prioritize-position, because reka's Popper runs shift before flip and shift alone can clamp a 0×0 point anchor's overflow to zero, starving flip of a signal.
In App.vue, onClickOutside for the detail region takes ignore '[data-reka-popper-content-wrapper]' so the force-delete Popover's outside-click doesn't trigger the detail-region dismiss handler.
The force-delete confirmation is a reka Popover that dismisses on outside-click and Escape, which the old hand-rolled popup never did.
app-shell.css was deleted once unused; no raw form controls remain in git-ui components. Webview test selectors moved from kui-segmented-badge, kui-tooltip and data-kui-tip onto reka surfaces.
git-ui main.ts keeps kira-ui residue only for Part 3: the vKuiTooltip import, the 'kui-tooltip' directive registration (Review still uses it), and the kui-bridge.css import.
git-ui has no wrapper layer over shadcn components: no defineComponent in components, no non-setup script blocks, no Git*Button-style wrapper files.
The RowContextMenu @contextmenu listener lives on RowActionsButton (the row's More actions button), not on the row's checkout button.
Search uses a two-stage Escape: the first Escape dismisses the dropdown and keeps the query; the second clears the query and closes search.
fakeGraphHost.ts does not vary --vscode-* variables between body.vscode-dark and body.vscode-light, so identical computed colors in both themes are expected.
apps/kira-studio/frontend has no dependency on @kira/git-ui; its only touch from this phase was an import-path rename and comment update in SlickGridHost.vue.
fakeGraphHost.ts's fixture never sets capabilities.write in its app.init response, so write-gated UI (inline rename, worktree-remove dialog; gated on actions?.capabilities.write in App.vue/BranchPicker.vue) is unreachable from it; branch-picker.spec.ts likewise never exercises write-mode UI.
fakeGraphHost.ts never mocks commit.detail (only fakeReviewHost.ts does, for /review), so DetailState.detail never resolves on /graph and CommitMeta/FileTree content under v-if="detail" never mounts there. commit-meta-clamp.spec.ts therefore uses its own commitMetaHarnessServer.ts mount.
In Kira Space's test app, installGitStreamMock's extraResults can mock commit.detail, so the detail pane can show real CommitMeta content.
The search toggle Button's color is rgb(204, 204, 204) in the VS Code webview (--kv-* bridged) and rgb(157, 157, 157) in Kira Space (unprefixed --kira-* root); the difference is intended because the two hosts' token tables are distinct.
graphStreamFixture.ts's minimal refs.list fixture renders zero .kv-badge in Kira Space, so App.vue's branch-tip-to-badge overlay needs more than that fixture wires; badge rendering is covered by graph-columns.spec.ts's "ref/tag badges render as outlines" test.
A standalone Playwright config outside apps/kira-space-vscode/tests/interaction or apps/kira-space/tests/ui cannot resolve @playwright/test's module graph, so scratch specs must be placed temporarily inside the real test tree.
In a shared checkout, commit with an explicit pathspec (git commit -m msg -- files), never git add -A or git add ., because concurrent sessions' changes must not be bundled.
In a shared checkout, use a scoped git stash push -u -- <path>, never bare git stash, so another session's unstaged edits are not overwritten or lost.

### v2.0 P131 Part 3 review view onto shadcn-vue; kira-ui cleanup
Part 2 of P131 created packages/git-ui/src/lib/{cn,rowVariants,menuModel}.ts (with menuModel.test.ts moved there) because its gate 'no kira-ui import except KuiColumnResizeHandle' could not pass without git-ui owning cn, rowVariants and the menu model.
After P131 Part 3, @kira/kira-ui exports only KuiColumnResizeHandle and floatingPosition, and maxVarPrefix is required in its float options (breaking change).
kira-ui keeps KuiColumnResizeHandle and floatingPosition because they have real consumers outside git-ui: App.vue/CommitGrid.vue and StreamView.vue use the resize handle, and packages/workbench/src/util/floatingPosition.ts uses the positioning primitive. No Kui* import is left in git-ui except KuiColumnResizeHandle.
packages/kira-ui/src contains exactly KuiColumnResizeHandle.vue, floatingPosition.ts and index.ts.
Outside kira-ui, only four files import from '@kira/kira-ui': git-ui App.vue and CommitGrid.vue (KuiColumnResizeHandle), StreamView.vue, and workbench/src/util/floatingPosition.ts.
packages/workbench/src/util/floatingPosition.ts types its FloatOptions as Omit<KuiFloatOptions, 'maxVarPrefix'> because the wrapper always supplies maxVarPrefix internally.
Both kui-bridge.css copies (packages/git-ui/src/theme and packages/theme/src) were deleted because their sole consumer, kira-ui's Kui* components, was gone; no reference to kui-bridge remains. check-class-conflicts.ts, check-tokens.sh, check-theme-classes.sh and docs/ARCHITECTURE.md were updated accordingly.
check-tokens.sh's kui- layer is now a strict zero-occurrence guard for --kui-* rather than a check that each resolves to a definition, since nothing is left to define.
Built CSS for Space, the VS Code webview and Studio contains no --kui- vocabulary. The only source hits for '--kui-' are in scripts/check-tokens.sh, whose guard pattern and description must contain it; this is the one accepted exception to the closing audit.
git-ui's review components (ReviewCommentsPane, ReviewCommitRow, ReviewFilesPane, BaseSelector, ReviewView) use shadcn-vue components from @theme/components (Button, TooltipIconButton, ToggleGroup, Popover, InputGroup, Input, Badge, AttributeTooltip) and git-ui's own lib/ copies of cn and rowVariants, with no raw input/select/textarea/checkbox, no defineComponent wrapper layer and no kira-ui/Kui references. The v-kui-tooltip directive and its main.ts registration were removed.
git-ui lib/cn.ts keeps only the class-merge groups that rowVariants.ts's retokening needs; the radius/leading groups and all kui-* keys were dropped.
The P131 §9 audit requires rg -n "kui-bridge" packages apps scripts to return no hit, so history comments must not name the deleted file by its literal name.
BranchPicker.vue's enabledNeighbour and firstEnabled come from ../lib/menuModel.ts, not @kira/kira-ui.
kira-ui's own src/**/*.test.ts entry was dropped from knip.json and root test:unit because its only test file was removed; git-ui's lib/menuModel.test.ts and refBadges.test.ts still run.
budgets.spec.ts in kira-studio ui tests is a known intermittent timing flake from cross-file worker contention, not a regression.
In Studio Playwright config, ui-timing has dependencies: ['ui'], so any ui failure skips ui-timing tests.
fakeReviewHost.ts answers only repo.list and review.target; it never answers review.comment.list or emits a stale event, so the Comments pane and stale-refresh banner cannot be reached in live checks through it.
fakeReviewHost.ts's harness does not vary --vscode-* tokens between the body.vscode-dark and body.vscode-light classes, so identical host-token results in both themes are expected, not a defect.
The Files pane's reviewed control is a three-state checkbox (checked, dashed/partial, unchecked), modeled by fakeReviewHost.ts fixtures FAKE_REVIEW_FILE_FULL/_PARTIAL/_NONE and covered by review-interaction.spec.ts.
reka-ui is installed at exactly version 2.10.5.
packages/theme PopoverContent.vue spreads $attrs (inheritAttrs false) directly onto reka's PopoverContent (the role=dialog element), so aria-label needs no labelled inner-div workaround.
BaseSelector Popover shifts back on-screen near a horizontal viewport edge without a sticky="always" override, verified by floating-geometry.spec.ts.
With reka-ui 2.10.5, ToggleGroupItem has role button, not radio, so review tests select it with getByRole('button', ...) and [aria-label^="Files"].
The BaseSelector modal Popover needs no nextTick wrap for @open-auto-focus or pick(): the filter input autofocuses on open and row clicks inside do not trigger outside-dismiss.
check-class-conflicts.ts's themeTokenNames regex already matches the shape of git-ui's @theme inline reference block, needing no extension.
The graph font-size plumbing (git.graphFontSize / --kira-graph-font-size) comes from P110/Part 1 and is untouched by P131 Part 3.

### v2.0 P132 Part 1 shared Operations panel and full-width dock (Kira Studio)
Kira Studio's Operations panel is the op-log dock: apps/kira-studio/frontend/src/workbench/panels/OperationsPanel.vue over the state/ops.ts store and packages/shared/domain/ops.ts's OpRecord.
The Operations panel is mounted through the shared shell's #dock slot in packages/workbench/src/components/WorkbenchShell.vue and toggled from TitleBar.vue, the view.toggleOperationsPanel shortcut (Cmd+J) and the Go menu.
Layout bug cause: the ops panel is nested inside main's own ResizablePanel in WorkbenchShell.vue, so it spans only main's column, and a margin-bottom hack (opsMarginPx) on the project panel leaves blank chrome under the left panel.
The OperationsPanel.vue comment claiming the layout matches the pre-P104 CSS grid, where ops spanned the full width, is incorrect.
Nesting an outer vertical resizable group around the horizontal one is recorded as hanging the render process under reka-ui and was never root-caused (reka-ui is now 2.10.5).
Part 1 fixes the layout by moving the dock out of the horizontal splitter group into a full-width flex sibling with a VueUse useDraggable px-height handle (DockResizeHandle.vue), and deleting opsMarginPx. The Studio dock now spans the full width.
The panel shell (virtualized list, status filter, expand-to-detail, cancel, copy) and a create*Store factory are extracted into packages/workbench, with Studio-only behaviour injected as seams: console re-run, reveal tab, connection colour, SQL-dialect detail through MonacoHost, ensureConnectedOnce.
The op-log is shared via an OpLogRecord base contract in packages/shared/domain/ops.ts (generalized off OpKind's DB-specific enum; Studio's OpRecord extends it), a createOpLogStore factory used by Studio state/ops.ts, and a shared OpLogPanel.vue that Studio's OperationsPanel.vue wraps.
toggleOperationsPanel and setOperationsHeight are hoisted from Kira Studio's state/layout.ts into createLayoutStore, which owns the operations panel actions; the shared Layout schema already carries panel.operations.
Kira Space has no op log. Its producer will be user-initiated git operations (gitsession.RepoEntry.RunOp/UndoRun and the remote ops in gitsession/remote.go), not gitclient.Runner, because every read spawn there would flood the list.
Kira Space binds shortcuts by keydown in workbench/WorkbenchShell.vue, so its Cmd+J toggle is a local binding (also reachable via the Go menu).
Whole-phase decisions: Kira Space history is an in-memory Go ring (Studio's is SQLite op_log with pruning), with Cmd+J via the Go menu; these are fixed in docs/v2.0/plans/P132-part1-shared-panel-and-dock.md §0-§2.
Acceptance for P132 includes a test:ui bounding-box assertion that the dock's left edge equals the project panel's left edge in both apps, with the tree/interaction/leaks specs as the hang-prone gate.
P132 was split into parts because the shared extraction plus layout rework gated by hang-prone specs, and the Go producer across four gitsession entry points plus a new bound service, are each a full pass; the split also keeps Part 1 off files P129 edits.
The dock is workbench chrome, not a module panel, so P128's module system is not a dependency; P132 runs after P128 because both edit Kira Space's workbench/WorkbenchShell.vue and TitleBar.vue.
P129 also edits apps/kira-space/main.go, internal/bridge/events.go and frontend/src/main.ts, so P132 runs after P129 by default; running alongside it needs user instruction and expects rebase conflicts.
Vue defineProps defaults cannot close over emit, because they are hoisted out of setup(); OpLogPanel.vue therefore uses plain fallback functions for canCancel and menuFor instead of withDefaults. vue-tsc alone does not catch this; only a real vite build does.
In DockResizeHandle.vue, ArrowUp grows the operations dock, matching drag-up-grows.
Border and rounding of the main panel must stay on an inner div, not on the ResizablePanel itself, because putting them on the ResizablePanel shifts reka's px-to-% conversion (project panel 260.078px vs 260.4375px baseline) and breaks visual snapshots.
The schema-dialog visual snapshot was flaky because Monaco's vertical scrollbar slider fades on a JS timer; the scrollbar is now masked in that snapshot.
With the dock closed, Studio's shell geometry is identical to baseline fb24ba56 (project width 260.4375px); the only differences are one removed redundant same-size wrapper box and a new #main-panel testid.
Kira Space's own op log (plan §2.6) is Part 2 of P132 and was not touched by Part 1.
In grep-based audits, use grep -L for files-without-match, because rg -L means --follow, not files-without-match.
Shared workbench code (OpLogPanel.vue) must not reference app-specific names such as Studio's MonacoHost, even in comments, per the plan §7 audit.

### v2.0 P132 Part 2 Kira Space op log
Kira Space op log is a stdlib-only in-memory ring of 500 entries in internal/oplog, shared by every window and process-global; history does not persist. Clear is per window.
gitsession logs writes to the op log via hooks on RunOp, UndoRun (which gains a connLabel), RunRemote with a non-nil conn (auto-fetch excluded) and RunRestack.
Op cancellation goes through CancelRemote/CancelRestack; OpsService exposes Recent and Cancel, and updates are pushed on the kira:op:update channel.
ChannelOpUpdate and ChannelToggleOperationsPanel live in internal/appevent, and onToggleOperationsPanel is in createCoreControl; the Space menu item toggles the operations panel with Cmd+J.
The shared workbench shell always mounts the dock; the hasDock option was removed.
internal/ade/queue.go needs no edit because the op-log hook sits in gitsession.
RunRestack is logged to the op log because the SPEC row and Part 1 §0.4 include it, though the task prompt said to exclude it; dropping it is one startOp call plus its test row, and the user must decide.
The native connection label was renamed from "This window" to "Kira Space", which also changes the undo tooltip (gitpreflight/undo.go:37) to "(window: Kira Space)".
Space frontend/bindings is gitignored, so generated bindings are regenerated locally with wails3 task common:generate:bindings and not committed.
spaceOpRecordSchema stays module-local in opsDomain.ts, and the bridge uses trust for ops methods like sibling methods, which do not parse through a schema.
The Space operations wrapper reads filter and status from the store (opsStore.filterText, statusFilter), because visibleOps needs them there, as in Studio.
startOp uses repoWorkingDir for repoRoot, so bare repos use the git dir.
The Space status bar shifts 4px because of an unconditional mt-1.
Space UI tests drive the operations toggle by emitting kira:menu:toggle-operations-panel through emitWailsEvent.

### v2.0 P133 Custom scripts configured only from the terminal module; Settings' Scripts pane removed
Custom scripts are configured only from the shared terminal module (a shadcn Dialog, QuickCommandsDialog.vue, launched from the TerminalPanel's Quick commands panel), not from the app Settings dialog; Settings' Scripts pane (ScriptsPane) and section were removed.
The only launch surface for scripts is the Terminal module's "Quick commands" panel; the tab strip's "+" offers "Terminal" only, and the 'script' launch kind is set only in TerminalPanel.vue.
Scripts editing moved to the terminal module instead of simply deleting the Scripts pane, because deleting alone would strand renaming, working directory and colour editing, which exist nowhere else.
A dialog is used for full script editing because a 180-480px Quick commands panel cannot hold four labelled fields legibly (P91 §11.3's reason).
QuickCommandsDialog field rules (carried from ScriptsPane): blur commits an edit; an empty value reverts; a rejected edit reverts and shows a message; colour changes apply immediately, with catch and colorSyncKey resync.
In QuickCommandsDialog, adding a script trims all four fields, shows errors, and resets the form on success; removal goes through useRemoveScript; drafts re-sync via watch with immediate:true.
Script storage stays per app behind P128's optional custom-scripts seam (TerminalScriptsSeam), which grew from list/create/remove to include update and lost openEditor; Kira Studio's custom_scripts table, internal/bridge/customscripts.go and state/customScripts.ts changed only in comments.
Kira Space gets no script storage in P133: its terminalModule.ts injects no scripts, so its terminal module has no Quick commands section until a later phase injects a store.
openSettingsAt is kept because CookiesPane.vue and RequestSettingsPane.vue still call it; the terminal module no longer calls it.
P133 depends on P128: it edits the shared TerminalPanel that P128 creates, so it must come after P128.
P133 acceptance: no Settings reference to scripts in either app; every script field editable from the terminal module; Kira Studio's suites pass.
TerminalPanel.vue delegates Edit/Manage/Remove to QuickCommandsDialog; scriptActions.ts was added. The gear reads "Manage quick commands…" and opens the dialog unfocused; context-menu "Edit…" opens it focused on the row.
Studio's terminalModule.ts wires update and keeps settingsStore for appearance.
Scripts UI test coverage moved from settings-scripts.spec.ts (deleted) into terminal-module.spec.ts; 'Scripts' was dropped from the sections list in tests/visual/settings.spec.ts and the Scripts settings visual baseline was replaced by a quick commands dialog baseline.
The Settings Scripts removal is marked as a breaking change (BREAKING CHANGE footer) in commit refactor(settings)!.
ARCHITECTURE documents QuickCommandsDialog.vue as the only script-editing surface.
All .vue files under packages/workbench/src/terminal use script setup lang=ts and have no style block.
The Settings schema in settingsDomain.ts has 7 keys, so the "eight (Kira Studio)" section-count comments in createSettingsStore.ts:71 and SettingsShell.vue:21 are inaccurate; they were deliberately left untouched.
Under ripgrep, -L means --follow (symlinks), not GNU grep's files-without-match; use rg --files-without-match to find files lacking a pattern.

### v2.0 P134 Fix intermittent flake in api-secret-reveal-isolation.spec.ts
The Variables dialog's secret checkbox (data-testid variable-secret in VariableRow.vue) is a packages/theme Checkbox over reka-ui's CheckboxRoot, a controlled role-based ARIA toggle, not a native input.
Unticking the secret checkbox calls onUpdateSecret, which awaits the revealVariable IPC round trip (re-auth) first, so aria-checked flips to unchecked only after the reveal resolves.
A cancelled reveal must leave the secret checkbox checked; the second test in api-secret-reveal-isolation.spec.ts pins this.
Playwright's .uncheck() clicks once and reads the checked state once with no retry, so it throws 'Clicking the checkbox did not change its state' on the secret checkbox when the reveal round trip is slow.
The P134 flake in api-secret-reveal-isolation.spec.ts was a test wait-shape problem, not an app bug; the fix replaced .uncheck() with secretBox.click() followed by await expect(secretBox).not.toBeChecked().
For a controlled ARIA toggle like the secret checkbox, click then poll with expect(...).not.toBeChecked() instead of .uncheck(), because .uncheck() reads state once with no retry; api-ui-consistency.spec.ts:1213 uses this shape.
The isolation spec's assertion of exactly 2 variablesReveal IPC calls guards that unticking secret in the Variables tab makes its own real reveal call rather than trusting the stale entry Copy-as-curl left in the shared revealedValues map.
Fixes for the secret-reveal flake must preserve the cross-dialog re-auth isolation guarantee, not weaken it to hide the flake.
P134 is independent of every other phase; the flake predates P128 and lies in the Api client's Variables-dialog secret-reveal UI, which P126-P133 do not touch.
In a shared checkout with concurrent agents, commit through a private index (GIT_INDEX_FILE) touching only the intended file, because a plain git commit without a pathspec picks up other agents' staged files.

### v2.0 P135 `ade` icon, dependency nodes, inline Jira line, extend-only estimate
Phase P135 merges four originally separate user requests (P135-P138) into one phase per explicit user instruction; the row keeps the lowest number and the plan implements them in order (1)-(4).
Icons in the ade module must come from the installed icon packs, never hand-drawn, and no new icon pack may be installed.
Icon call sites in apps/kira-space/frontend/src/ade/*.vue go through @theme/CodiconIcon.vue, which wraps @vscode/codicons, a root package.json dependency; @lucide/vue and simple-icons are also root deps but unused in ade.
The new-session button in AdeAgentsTab.vue uses the add codicon (CodiconIcon name="add") instead of a hand-drawn inline SVG copied from the mockup (docs/v2.0/design/mockup.html:415).
AdeActivityGlyph.vue's five activity dots/badges and the typographic marks (↳, ✓, ↑, ·) in ade components are deliberate CSS shapes/glyphs mirroring the mockup, a disclosed P129 Part 5 decision, and are not icon-pack candidates.
Items are branch-shaped: ItemKind is 'mine' | 'review' | 'parked' and Item/QueueItem always carry git facts (branch, base, ahead/behind, files, commits) computed by apps/kira-space/internal/ade/facts.go and queue.go; nothing else models a wait with no branch.
A 'parked' item is kept out of merge order with overlaps ignored; it sits on the timeline, takes a plan day and counts toward day totals, but never enters merge/conflict/PR logic.
Dependency nodes represent external waits (vendor response, another team's release, third-party review), follow the parked shape but are never a branch (no worktree, no ahead/behind, no archive-at-risk check), and exist to be linked as blockers on a real item.
A dependency node is a new item kind 'dependency' with title, free-text description and optional expected-by date, rendered as its own distinctly colour-coded timeline box.
A real work item can link one or more dependency nodes as blockers, shown on the blocked item (e.g. a chip).
ADE dependency nodes are stored in the ade_dependencies and ade_blockers tables, created by migration 0006_p135_ade_dependencies.
The ADE scheduling rule for a dependency: it is never scheduled ahead of the earliest day a blocked item needs it resolved by (implemented in useQueue.ts applyDependencyDays).
ADE dependencies carry no git facts, merge position, conflicts, shares, or PR/CI state: DependencyFact has only ID, Title, WaitingOn, ExpectedBy, CreatedAt and Blocks, facts.go never references dependencies, and dependency methods never call openRepo.
Dependency items are excluded from merge ordering, hours, and drag in useQueue.ts, and render as a dotted box in AdeStackBlock.vue.
Work-item ids in the AdeService bridge are validated with validateAdeWorkItemID, which refuses dependency ids prefixed 'dep:'.
A dependency can be created via a third 'Dependency' tab in AdeAddPopover.vue, and linked as a blocker via the dependency detail panel (AdeDependencyDetails.vue, AdeBlockerRow.vue).
item.jiraKey is plumbed onto every Item/QueueItem from b.jira.key; Jira was previously readable only in the detail panel's AdeLinkRow.vue (parseJira in jira.ts).
Timeline rows (AdeStackRow.vue, AdeStackBlock.vue) show a Jira key/title on a second line only for items with a non-empty jiraKey; row height is 56px for Jira items versus 40px otherwise, shared via rowHeight.ts. The link opens with target=_blank, with no live Jira API call and no sync state.
Row-height changes must not misalign sibling rows in AdeDayBand.vue and AdeContinuationRow.vue or break drag-and-drop hit-testing (data-ade-box / data-ade-row-movable), because P129 Part 5 built that hit-testing.
The Go backend has no Jira client; Jira is display-only.
An ADE estimate is extend-only once set: it can only grow, a fresh value is still freely settable, and the 'spans N days' hint keeps updating. It is enforced on the client (AdeEstimateField.vue commits @change only when unlocked) and on the server by checkEstExtends, which returns ErrEstimateShrink mapped in adeQueueError.
The hours/days unit may need to lock once an estimate is set, because converting units without a fixed ratio could shrink the committed duration.
P135 acceptance: rg for '<svg|<path d=' in apps/kira-space/frontend/src/ade returns empty with no package.json change.
P135 is independent of P126, P129 Part 7 and P131-P132 (different files); P136 depends on this phase landing first.
The AdeService bridge (bridge/ade.go) exposes 23 exported methods.
The knip lint:dead run has pre-existing findings (duplicate exports in Kira Studio page columns, git-core graph types, git-ui rowMenuModel, shared domain/repo and protocol/page) outside P135's scope; fixing them needs its own named follow-up phase in SPEC.md.
The Add-popover UI tests live in ade-timeline.spec.ts, not ade-dialogs.spec.ts, which covers only the Claude Code send dialog.

### v2.0 P136 Main timeline defaults to the top 5 "my work" items; rest behind a show-more toggle
The main repo timeline shows only the top 5 qualifying "my work" stacks by default, with the rest behind a plain show-more toggle; it does not use the History-bar scroll-pull mechanic (historyOpen/historyReach), which stays reserved for past days.
Work type is stored in a new work_type field beside kind, with values work, investigate, review, test; migration 0007 adds the columns and backfills review where kind = 'review'.
Work type invariant: work/investigate pair with kind mine/parked; review/test pair with kind review. New work accepts only work or investigate.
SetWorkType is its own write path (repo, Queue, AdeService). It refuses review/test while blockers exist (ErrWorkTypeBlocked) and on new work (ErrWorkTypeInvalid); both return E_INVALID. Rebind carries work_type.
The details panel Kind select (AdeWorkTypeField.vue, shadcn NativeSelect) disables review/test options while the item is blocked; a refused write shows an inline error and reverts.
The top-5 cap is UI-level (myWorkCap.ts); useQueue still computes bands and hours over all items, so day totals and capacity stay correct.
Cap ranking keeps the top 5 non-parked, non-dependency stacks ordered by (merged last, earliest segment day, segment index), plus dependencies blocking a kept member.
showAllWork is a runtime ref in AdeRepoView.vue only, reset on repo-tab switch; selecting a hidden item expands the list once per id. AdeMyWorkToggle.vue sits under the main line.
A pulled-in branch by another author defaults to the review kind via resolveKind; change resolveKind if a different default is wanted.
hiddenCount counts hidden parked stacks and unlinked dependencies, so the show-more toggle can appear with zero hidden work stacks.
UI test scenarios that need hidden rows must expand first via showAllWork in tests/ui/support/ade.ts.
Playwright selectOption never opens the OS native select popup, so the native select popup in WebKitGTK/WKWebView is not covered by UI tests.

### v2.0 P137 `ade`'s repo tab bar becomes the shared `TabStrip`, drag-reorder onto vue-draggable-plus
The shared TabStrip.vue (packages/workbench/src/components/TabStrip.vue) is used by Kira Studio, Kira Space terminal tabs and ade repo tabs; it takes an optional host prop (TabStripHost) and falls back to useWorkbenchHost(). A capability absent from the host hides its affordance.
TabStrip exposes a #tab-leading slot and a pinnedTitle kind flag that gives a labelled pinned chip; pinned chips sit outside the sortable row.
TabStrip drag-reorder uses vue-draggable-plus (useDraggable on the scrolling row, forceFallback, bound id mirror, one moveTab call per drop) and no longer uses native HTML5 DnD.
vue-draggable-plus was chosen for drag-reorder because Playwright can drive forceFallback with a plain mouse.move/down/up sequence, while the HTML5 drag API has no such hook.
ade repo tabs render through TabStrip via useAdeTabStripHost.ts; AdeRepoTabs.vue is kept (AdeView.vue unchanged) as a thin wrapper, with needs-input counts in #tab-leading, no close and no reorder.
ade tab tests use [data-testid="tab"] with data-tab-kind and data-tab-id; active state is data-active. The old ade-repo-tab and ade-all-agents-tab test ids are gone.
The ade tab bar lost its amber top border, #2a2d35 right border and #d97757 icon tint, and now uses the shared chip style for the active tab.
ade tab chips lost reka Tabs arrow-key roving and role="tab"; they are now Tab-focusable buttons.
Sortable fallback mode emulates dragover on a 50ms tick, so a test drag must hover before mouse.up (300ms was used).
Studio ui-timing perf tests (budgets, slick-grid, perf specs) fail intermittently, a different pair each run, because budgets are machine-bound; they are known flakes and were not fixed.
Tooltip wait in document-view-readonly.spec.ts was raised from 1s to 3s because it failed under a loaded test pool.
ade repo drag-reorder would need a persisted repo order path shared with the Git panel; not implemented.
useDragReorder still has three consumers that could be migrated to vue-draggable-plus; not yet done.
P137 added no dependency: package.json and bun.lock are unchanged, since vue-draggable-plus was already a root entry; createTabsStore.ts is untouched.
P129 Part 7's pinned "All agents" tab should build on TabStrip's built-in pinned-tab slot; whichever of P137 or P129 Part 7 lands second must check the other's state first.

### v2.0 P138 `ade`'s chrome brought onto `packages/theme` tokens, matching the rest of the Kira apps
In ade, only tone tints (green/amber/red/blue/grey/purple) and the 20-color work palette stay literal hex data values, because they encode meaning, not theme; all other visual tokens map to packages/theme tokens (--kira-*, Tailwind utilities).
P138 audited 279 hex literals in ade: 109 kept (57 distinct values, which form the gate allowlist), 162 remapped onto --kira-* tokens or utilities, 3 normalized onto kept values, 5 comments reworded.
In ade TypeScript style sites read colours from TONE, TONE_INK and DEPENDENCY_COLOR, and a single activityTextColor replaces two copies of stateColor.
Kept literal colours in ade template classes must be spelled out in full as literals, because Tailwind v4 needs them spelled out.
scripts/check-ade-colours.sh is chained into bun run lint; it fails on any non-kept hex literal in ade (comments included) and on a stale allowlist entry.
AdeNotesEditor.vue keeps its single style scoped block, with literals swapped to var(); it is the only ade file with a style block.
P138 made no change to packages/theme, dependencies (apart from the lint line in package.json), Go code or tests.
Claude orange #d97757 in ade is now Kira blue (--primary) for Start buttons, robot icons, session tab rail and count pill. Reverting is possible in tones.ts plus four class sites, at the cost of a 58th kept value.
Light theme for ade is a follow-up, not P138's acceptance bar: no light theme exists, and kept tone text has only 1.6-2.4:1 contrast on white. It is recorded in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md Known open items.
Some kept tone colours have pre-existing contrast under 4.5:1: white on purple solid is 3.35:1 and ink on grey solid is 3.60:1 (11-12px button labels); fixing would change a tone.
In ade, the selection rail, active-tab underline and drop highlight changed from amber to blue by role (plan §3.5), so amber is not used as chrome.
Outside tones.ts, #e8a33d remains only for three data states: overdue "Move to today", "Rebase all", and the input glyph. #f28b7d is used only for state roles, and text-[#7aa7ff] only for the other-author name in AdeAddPopover.
P138 plan is docs/v2.0/plans/P138-ade-theme-tokens.md and the hex audit is docs/v2.0/plans/P138-ade-hex-audit.md.

### v2.0 P139 Part 1 Fix flaky Studio UI timing tests and gofmt flags
Kira Studio's ui-timing Playwright project (apps/kira-studio/playwright.config.ts) selects specs by title /150ms sandbox gate|interaction budgets|perf tripwires/ and runs wall-clock specs in budgets.spec.ts, slick-grid.spec.ts and perf.spec.ts.
Never skip, disable or quarantine a flaky timing test; root-cause and fix it. Loosen a budget only with measured evidence that the budget, not the code, is wrong.
P139 acceptance: ui-timing passes on 3 consecutive full `bun run test:ui:studio` runs, gofmt -l apps/ is empty, and golangci-lint reports 0 issues.
budgets.spec.ts:432 failed because the scroll-work mark sat before SlickGrid's scrollRenderThrottling; moving the mark to KiraSlickGrid.render() entry cut work p50 from 12-17 ms to 6-8 ms with the 12 ms budget unchanged.
budgets.spec.ts:797 timed out because a synthetic click() hit a div with no handler; the test now targets the inner button.
slick-grid.spec.ts:896 (150ms sandbox gate) failed because the model range push cost 80-130 ms of real work; select-all now bypasses the model (P22 D6), giving 3-36 ms.
perf.spec.ts:119 had no code cause and was left unchanged; p95 measured 41-59 ms across 20+ runs against an 80 ms budget, and it stays load-sensitive (73 ms under synthetic load).
repo-workspace.spec.ts:228 failure was a real app race: a search event arriving before the StartSearch reply was dropped; fixed with a search event buffer, verified by a hold spec that fails 100% without the fix.
ade-panel.spec.ts:430 could not be reproduced (0 of 160 baseline failures); its assertion was tightened to count writes only.
MonacoHost.vue sets wordBasedSuggestions to 'off' whenever autocomplete is on, because a cold SQL console with no source showed a stale-word suggestion widget mid-typing, failing sql-schema.spec.ts:439.
formatters: gofmt was added to .golangci.yml and gofmt was applied to 26 Go files; gofmt -l apps/ internal/ is empty and lint:go reports 0 issues with the formatter enabled.
In the grid, Shift+arrow after select-all extends from the active cell.
Cached tab switch is slow (p50 292-357 ms, p95 338-510 ms) against the 50 ms PERF.md budget, hidden by a 1000 ms bound; it is unfixed and tracked as P139 Part 2.
The shift-click range check at slick-grid.spec.ts:1810 still counts kira-cell-selected cells, which is correct because a range goes through the model.

### v2.0 P139 Part 2 cached tab switch regression; restore PERF.md §2.1 bounds in `budgets.spec.ts`
In budgets.spec.ts the assertions were toBeLessThanOrEqual(1000) although section headers said p95 <= 50ms (cell to editor, cached tab switch, cached tree expand) and p50 <= 50ms (console keystroke), per docs/PERF.md §2.1; the 1000 ms bound hid a real regression.
Cached tab switch slowdown root cause: every switch remounts DataView and SlickGrid, and SlickGrid's per-grid <style> (append, rule mutation, removal) forces a full-document style rebuild of about 55 ms each on WebKit; columns were also built twice per mount.
KiraSlickGrid overrides createCssRules, removeCssRules and applyColumnWidths to set --sg-l<i>/--sg-r<i> custom properties on the grid root, over one shared append-only stylesheet, instead of a per-grid style element.
No tab caching was used for the tab switch fix (user decision); the iteration 1 caching work was reverted, keeping only ba41ec3f.
The tab switch bound in budgets.spec.ts is p95 <= 300 ms (WebKit sandbox bound), not 50 ms, because a real remount costs about 47 ms of Vue work on the sandbox WebKit (about 29 ms on Chromium) and Tailwind v4's @property fallback, live only on this WebKit build (no margin-trim), doubles every restyle. After the fix: p50 113-125 ms, p95 159-194 ms (before: 311-318 / 436-447).
Restored budgets: cell to editor p95 <= 50 ms, tree expand p95 <= 50 ms, keystroke p50 <= 50 ms and max <= 200 ms.
Dropping Tailwind's @property fallback (via a PostCSS plugin) was declined by the user because it is a build-wide CSS change for a sandbox-only effect; with it dropped tab switch p95 measured 136-162 ms, custom properties alone 170-212 ms.
A machine-independent guard in budgets.spec.ts asserts zero <style>/<link> churn in <head> (Monaco's per-editor media="screen" sheets excluded) and zero .slickgrid_ rules across 20 tab switches.
Real WKWebView tab switch numbers (p50/p95 of 20 switches, CSS.supports('margin-trim: inline')) remain unmeasured and need a Mac; tracked in PERF.md §3 and ARCHITECTURE.md Known open items.
The >256-column chunk growth in ensureColumnRules is untested; slick-grid.spec.ts covers resize and frozen gutter, and budgets.spec.ts covers 2 and 60 columns.
CommitGrid.vue still uses a per-grid stylesheet, and the budgets.spec.ts horizontal and wide-vertical <= 1000 sanity bounds are unchanged; both are out of scope of P139 Part 2.

### v2.0 P140 Drag-reorder: `ade` repo tabs; migrate `useDragReorder` consumers
ade repo tab order is stored in the existing code_repos.sort_order column; no migration was added.
CodeReposRepo.Reorder rewrites sort_order densely in one transaction, skipping unknown ids and appending unlisted rows.
CodeWorkspaceService.ReorderRepos validates that the id list is non-empty and has unique ids.
Newly imported repos land last in the order; removing a repo leaves a harmless gap in sort_order.
The reorderCodeRepos store action reassigns records optimistically, then with the server echo; on rejection it re-hydrates and rethrows. The ade adapter reports failures through adeActions.actionError.
The Git panel reads the same records array as the ade tabs, so it shows the reordered repos without any edit.
util/useSortableReorder.ts wraps vue-draggable-plus useDraggable with forceFallback, a bound id mirror, one onMove per drop and a reactive disabled option. It is used by TabStrip, ColumnsMenu, EnvironmentsView and VariableSetView.
useSortableReorder binds when the container appears (immediate: false plus start(el)), because reka popover content and the v-else variable list are absent at mount and a null root logged console errors.
The old useDragReorder.ts was deleted after all consumers migrated to useSortableReorder on vue-draggable-plus.
The ColumnsMenu list container is always mounted, with loading text inside it, so the sortable binds once.
Environment rows drag by the grip only, because the rows hold inputs and a radio.
Reordering imported linked worktrees can change the Git panel's worktree anchor (RepoWorktreeLinks rule).
Repo order has no cross-window live sync: another window sees the new order only after reload, same as rename.
In the Columns menu test, grid-header-cell order is not asserted after a reorder, because the grid header only rebuilds on a page reload, not on a columnOrder patch (pre-existing behavior).
api-secret-reveal-isolation.spec.ts no longer asserts a draggable attribute, since Sortable sets none. It now drags while filtered and expects no variablesReorder call.
The real ReorderRepos round trip is proven by the Go test TestCodeReposRepo_Reorder, not by the mocked UI suite.

### v2.0 P141 Code review round 1 of 2
Code review process: one Opus reviewer covers architecture/structure/maintainability/security, functional correctness/business logic, and performance/resource efficiency, and only reports; it writes findings to docs/v2.0/plans/P141-code-review.md (base commit stated) and commits it before any fixer starts.
After the review, one sequential Sonnet fixer commits per group of related findings (same file, module or root cause); the findings file is deleted once every finding is fixed; a finding needing a real design decision becomes its own named SPEC.md phase.
ADE Store.Rebind always binds as mine, keeping the new work's work_type, and no longer takes a kind parameter; resolveKind remains for AddBranch and Candidates.
ADE tipReachableFromMain is hasMain && depths[b] == 0; Snapshot reads git inventory once and passes it to reconcileNewWork, which no longer reads user.email.
After a rebind the git inventory is not re-read, because Rebind only touches the DB and cannot change git inventory.
ADE session listing uses ListByRepo on the ade_sessions_repo index, one read per reconcileNewWork, and cwdMissing stats only stopped rows.
The ade_sessions table still grows without a retention rule for Sessions(); a cutoff or retention would drop resumable history, needs a product decision, and is not scheduled.
ArchiveRisk returns the MainRef error.
UpdateNewWork is scoped to repo and live rows; SetBranchMeta refuses non-notes patches on review branches with ErrReviewNotesOnly.
ADE openRepo tries Conn.Entry first and uses a gitRepoIDOf map.
ADE SessionStart session ids are accepted only if uuid.Parse succeeds, and both launch commands POSIX-quote the id.
Prepare refuses a resume with ErrSessionRunning when pending or byRecord already holds the record, checked under the same lock as the pending insert.
Duplicate snapshot/PR invalidations are dropped for every write Go pushes for; kept are sessions after launch and bind, candidates after AddBranch, snapshot and PRs after a failed Archive or Refresh, and bind's snapshot (BindNewWork pushes sessions only).
The Space UI mock has no Go push, so it emits kira:ade:repo after each successful ADE write.
ADE UI callbacks read args.codeRepoId.
AdeRepoView and AdeAllAgentsView call useQueue with NO_ACTIVITY; AdeRepoView overlays acts, agents and panel running kinds (queueActivity.ts) keyed on a per-terminal kind map that keeps its identity until a phase moves; useQueue's API is unchanged.
The ADE notes editor emits (itemId, markdown), and useItemMeta.setNotes(itemId, ...) writes to that id: an nw: prefix means new work, otherwise a branch.
Studio has RequirePathPrefix next to RequirePath, used by s3 resolveBucketSegment and redis resolveDatabaseSegment; this resolved the redis ARCHITECTURE Known open item, which was removed.

### v2.0 P142 Code review round 2 of 2
Tracker.Prepare refuses a resume only when byRecord holds the record; a pending duplicate drops older intents for that record.
Compose reserves byRecord under t.mu before MarkRunning, returns ErrSessionRunning on a held record, and releases the reservation if MarkRunning errors.
Reconcile ignores the byRecord reservation until spawnedAt is set.
FileTree parent picker uses classes kv:gap-0.5 kv:px-3 kv:pb-2, and the toolbar uses kv:gap-1 kv:px-2 kv:pb-1.
install.sh dies when the release reports no sha256: digest, because no documented install path relies on a missing digest; the message states ad-hoc codesign detects corruption only.
prepare-worktree.sh runs apt-get update -qq and install --no-install-recommends, with a sudo prefix when not root; docs/DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md matches.
install.sh runs on macOS only, since it uses shasum, hdiutil and codesign.

### v2.0 P143 ADE v2 contract freeze: wire types, IPC surface, fixtures (Done)
P143 froze the whole v2 wire contract from SPEC2.md §12 as Go wire structs in internal/bridge/adewire and a TS mirror in frontend/src/ade/v2/wire.ts.
The frozen contract covers Task, Branch, Run, Session, Workflow, Stage, PipelineStep, Plan, BacklogItem, Repo, Folder, WorktreeSetup, Deployment and integration status types, plus the method and push-channel list for P144-P148.
A frozen wire contract is what makes the backend/frontend split across two worktrees safe in every later wave.
The contract includes allowed_tools and a derived read-only status.
User decisions D1-D16 are recorded in preplan §6, with still-open items O1-O5 listed there.
Fixtures derived from ade-v2/mockup.html live under apps/kira-space/tests/fixtures/ade-v2/, and one Go test decodes every fixture with unknown fields disallowed.
The frozen contract has 96 types (6 string aliases, 90 structs, 333 JSON keys), 47 bound methods, 9 channels and 23 fixtures, each fixture matching a test-table entry.
The TS mirror exposes the 9 channels as CHANNEL keys, and knip.json has an entry for it.
The adewire wire.go contains no omitempty tags.
The ADE v2 design inputs live at docs/v2.0/design/ade-v2/, not design/ade-v2/.
Go wire.go was generated once from wire.ts by a throwaway script, so Go and TS key sets match by construction; string aliases are Go type X = string and inline unions are string with the value set in a trailing comment.
Fixture ids chosen where the plan left them open: d_alerts_api|web and d_csv_api|web (not-created branches), H_1-H_5 (history), R_omar/p_rate (add-existing), tk01 (extra TUI session resuming claude-9d10), repo-oss-core|docs.
In the fixtures, plan.order ends with T_spike, and Run rows link sessionId only where a mockup session exists; other done runs carry an empty string.

### v2.0 P144 ADE v2 wave 1: task store and workflow reader (Stream A) ‖ board logic (Stream B) (Done)
Migration 0008 adds 11 v2 tables (task, branch, run, plan, backlog, color, repo config, folder, environment, worktree-setup) and leaves v1 ade_sessions readable; the ade_sessions change moves to P146.
There is no v1 data migration for the v2 store (decision D5).
The internal/adeflow package reads workflow YAML with go.yaml.in/yaml/v3 and validates it, including aliases, allowed_tools and the 'only <repo>' syntax.
The workflows directory lives under the app home folder with no seeded default workflows (D2); readers never create it (adeflow.Dir(home) only joins paths).
The board snapshot reuses internal/ade per-repo facts and runs a git merge-tree rebase-conflict check on visible branches after refresh, cached by base and tip sha, with checking and failed states (D1).
Git operations use the git CLI only; go-git is not used in apps/kira-space.
The 20 AdeTaskService bound methods match 20 adeTask* entries in bridge/index.ts and 20 generated binding exports.
The board emits three channels, kira:adetask:board, kira:adetask:backlog and kira:adetask:credential, via TaskBoard.OnBoard, OnBacklog and OnCredential in board.go, wired in main.go.
Board logic in frontend/src/ade/v2/board/ is pure logic covering per-task timeline and merge order, a first-10 cap with load-all (D4), ripple/On merge, stage progress and percent, derived status, task and branch action first-match tables, base marker, and Needs-you derivation.
Streams A and B share no file; Stream B imports only P143 types. P144 needs P143 plus a serial wire step 0 adding conflict-check state on Branch.
layeringtest.RunAllowing was added at the repo root; it allows only the suffix /internal/bridge/adewire, which imports nothing else from bridge.
Branch owner is an empty string for own commits, and lastCommitAt is in milliseconds.
The needsYou board logic takes no Prs argument; the parity spec normalizes fixtures against the mockup and keeps DIVERGENCE (the b_deps CI chip is dropped per D9).
go test ./apps/kira-space/internal/gitsock flakes intermittently, with review.files and review.comment.add returning E_INTERNAL: read |0: file already closed. It is pre-existing, probably a pipe-close race in gitclient streaming Process under CPU load, and needs its own follow-up row.
Running test:ui:space requires apt-get install libavif16 in addition to the webkit libs; this is documented in docs/DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md.

### v2.0 P145 ADE v2 wave 2: workflow editing, repos config, integration and deploy facts (A) ‖ shell, Plan timeline, task cards, A... (Done)
Rebase and Queue after dialogs moved from P145 to P148 (U1 (a)).
P145 needs P144; wave 2 stream B consumes only P144 methods.
Migration 0009 was added in P145; the P146 migration is 0010.
The six @tiptap/* packages stay under a temporary knip.json ignore until P146's Notes tab uses them.
knip.json entries ade/v2/wire.ts and ade/v2/board/*.ts stay because 14 exports and 83 types have no caller until P146+; dropping them is deferred (§7).
The gitsock tests set KIRA_HOME, but storage.Open() reads KIRA_SPACE_HOME, so tests calling storage.Open() share ~/.kira-space/kira.db across packages and runs; this likely contributes to the gitsock flake (P152).
A B0 worktree run against a DB already migrated to schema 9 fails with 'schema_version (9) is newer'.
The gitsock flake is not fixed in P145; it occurs at a comparable rate on B0 and tip, with different tests failing per run (file.read / review.comment.add errors), and is recorded as P152.
P145 wave 2 added workflow write/import/watch via fsnotify with a last-valid rule, and repo config: nickname, folders, watch, integration branches, environments, prepare timeout.
The repo list is shared with the Git module (D15).
Merged/stale/not-merged status per integration branch is computed by patch-id; an app-recorded merge is stored only when the merge dialog finishes (D14).
No merged-chip UI exists until P146.
P145 stream B added the new AdeView root (tab bar, capture box, + Add task), plan header repo chips, per-task timeline with drag without dialog, task cards, branch rows, git action column, Add popover and Force push confirm dialog, and deleted the v1 frontend.
The bridge AddExistingBranch rejected an empty taskId (new task) with 'taskId is required'; fixed in commit 886f57db.
11 unused v1 exported types and the v1 bridge calls only they used were removed from ade/wire.ts, along with the AdeBranchMetaPatch family.

### v2.0 P146 ADE v2 wave 3: worktree setup and headless run engine (A) ‖ panel, Backlog, merged/deployed UI (B) (Done)
P146 stream A built migration 0010 (ade_sessions rebuild, moved from P144; 0009 belongs to P145), worktree creation, a prepare script with per-repo timeout, and setup states/log/gate.
The headless runner uses claude -p --output-format stream-json, passes allowed_tools via --allowedTools, takes --setting-sources from an app setting, has no concurrency cap, and persists a live log per run.
The finish_step MCP server is implemented with modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk; the step machine covers scope, gates, retry and timeouts, and once scripts run in the first branch worktree (D12).
P146 stream B built panel task mode (Task, Notes), branch mode (Details incl. Merged into and Deployed to as display only; Changes), a branch row merged/deployed line, the Backlog page, and a headless setting-sources switch.
The right-click fix menu, merge dialog and Merge / Re-merge buttons were moved from P146 to P148 B (deviation M1).
P146 needs P145; stream B consumes only P144-P145 methods.
Both ade/v2 knip entries (ade/v2/wire.ts and ade/v2/board/*.ts) must stay, because dropping them fails lint:dead; this is expected before P148.
The {branch} template variable prints unquoted when quotePOSIX deems it safe.
A run held behind a failed setup keeps the note: waiting for worktree setup
The headless setting-sources switch writes immediately rather than on dialog Save; a draft-bound version needs SettingsDialog.vue and settings/types.ts and is assigned to P148 B.
23 test files in gitrpc, gitsession, ade and bridge still open the real review.db; this is tracked as SPEC row P154.
The headless sources setting is stored as ade.headlessSettingSources (e.g. "user").
No UI caller can start a run before P147 B, so worktree setup, step machine and finish_step through the bridge are covered only by engine tests with a fake claude and the stream A real-claude smoke.

### v2.0 P147 ADE v2 wave 4: send-back, Take over, interactive stages, task archive (A) ‖ Workflows, Repos, run UI (B) (Done)
P147 send-back works via `claude -p --resume`, with up to 3 rounds; a send-back round trip resumes the same Claude session id (verified with claude 2.1.289).
Take over runs `claude --resume` in a TUI.
On restart recovery, runs in `running` state become `stuck` and are not auto-resumed (decision D7); the user uses Retry.
P147 stream A added interactive user-stage launch with prompt, single-branch Start, and archive per task.
The Workflows page has Form and YAML modes and an empty state with Import YAML and + New (D2). Stream B also built the Repos page, live stage progress, a panel Workflow block with per-repo step lines, a Run dialog, Approve/Retry/Done/Finish, a Release block and worktree setup UI.
P147 stream B consumes only the P144-P146 methods, and P147 needs P146.
After P147, AdeTaskService has 47 bound methods with 47 matching `adeTask*` entries in bridge/index.ts, a new channel `kira:adetask:open-session` emitted from FocusSession, and no migration added (0010 is still the last).
The ADE v2 contract (wire.ts, adewire, tests/fixtures/ade-v2, packages/shared) was untouched since B0. Nothing under ade/v2/ imports ade/wire.ts or uses scoped <style> or defineComponent.
ADE reads the git path from the setting `settings.git.path` rather than discovering it. If unset, StartRun fails with `E_INTERNAL ... exec: no command`.
A repo's setup script runs before its run: in the live smoke the `api` run started only after its 5.2s setup row finished.
Finish ✓ marks the task tag `✓ merged` and leaves no action button (R22).
A failed `tests` stage is sent back to Implement with a round counter (e.g. `fixed marker missing → back to Implement (1 of 3)`). A broken YAML edit shows an error and the last valid version stays in use.
Held fix runs lose `runOpts` across restart and launch as a plain fresh attempt.
A taken-over stuck or failed run gets `finish_step` from the TUI (R14); the UI for it is P148 B.
The P148 B UI must wire these methods: TakeOver, LaunchStage, StartBranch, Send, ArchiveRisk, ArchiveTask, FocusSession, RecordMerge, Sessions, plus onAdeTaskSessions and onAdeTaskOpenSession. They have no UI caller before then.
Todo progress is unobservable in `claude -p` 2.1.289 (open for the user).
The knip entries for `ade/v2/wire.ts` and `ade/v2/board/*.ts` must stay until P148: dropping them fails `lint:dead` because of unused wire.ts exports.
The engine test `waitUntil` in `workflows_test.go` was raised from 10s to 45s because multi-process chains exceed 10s under `-race`.

### v2.0 P148 ADE v2 wave 5: v1 backend removal (A) ‖ Sessions, Take over, Needs you, task archive UI (B) (Done)
P148 removed the v1 ADE backend: v1-only AdeService methods, queue code and v1 ade/wire.ts were deleted. Migration 0011 drops the v1 tables and v1 sessions with no data migration (D5); v2 tasks and sessions stay intact.
v1 tables now exist only in migrations 0005-0007 and 0011.
The merge dialog has 'Also push develop' off by default, uses a develop worktree template, and calls RecordMerge on finish (D14).
The repo fix menu is a right-click menu built on the shared shadcn context-menu primitive, not the mockup's bespoke popup (deviation R20).
The headless setting-sources switch is bound to the settings dialog draft and written only on Save; Cancel leaves the DB unchanged. It is stored as ade.headlessSettingSources.
Take over everywhere calls TakeOver with stopIfRunning:true and shows a confirm dialog when the run is live (D3, R13). A taken-over stuck or failed run can be finished from the TUI (R14).
The Sessions tab shows TUI sessions and a read-only headless log, reachable without taking over.
The stage dialog '▶ <Stage>' uses LaunchStage (R15) and '▶ Start' uses StartBranch (R16). Merge, rebase and queue dialogs launch through StartBranch, or Send to a running session (R16, R17).
Task archiving calls ArchiveRisk first, then ArchiveTask, with no discard flag (R18).
Needs you order follows SPEC2 section 11 rank, an accepted difference from the mockup. The TUI pane uses a real xterm, and Take over has a confirm (D3).
The headless status bar has a Stop button, which SPEC2 does not show, so that StopRun has a caller (deviation R15).
There are 47 bound AdeTaskService methods and 47 adeTask* entries, each with a caller. No code references AdeService apart from AdeTaskService.
Held fix runs lose their resume spec across a restart. This is an open carry-forward item, also listed in ARCHITECTURE.md open items.
Todo progress cannot be observed in claude -p 2.1.289.
In claude -p, a standalone sleep N is blocked and backgrounded, so a long-running step needs a loop such as until [ -f flag ]; do sleep 2; done.
The run dialog default text keeps the {repo}, {branch} and {worktree} placeholders for a once step; they are expanded per branch at launch.
The archive flow lives in dialog/flow.ts; archive/useArchive.ts was not created.

### v2.0 P149 ADE v2 closing: full suites, live mockup comparison, architecture docs (Done)
The P149 audit (plans/P149-audit.md) found 107 rows ok (16 accepted or superseded) and 1 gap routed to P155; every row of SPEC2 §1-§13, design §9 and the preplan matrix has evidence, with no silently dropped requirement.
Audit gap F1: the settings leaf ade.allAgentsFilter is dead, tracked in P155.
Audit gap F3: held fix runs lose their resume spec, tracked in P156 (resume spec column).
The stale-deploy grammar defect (F2) was found in the mockup comparison and fixed in commit 351be864.
tree.spec.ts:158 in the Studio UI suite was a real hover race, fixed in commit c84e9317; the stale-chip hover retry (2387223f) was reviewed as a real pointer race, not a masked defect.
The sample workflows standard, bugfix and chore import and validate, show the indentation error while keeping the last valid file, and a copied file appears without reload.
No todo tool is offered in claude -p 2.1.289, so todo progress needs a CLI that offers a todo tool in -p mode.
Accepted ADE v2 deviations include: go-git declined (D1, merge-tree); Stop button on the headless bar (R15); fix menu on the shared context-menu primitive (R20); Needs you ordered by SPEC2 §11 rank; All sessions Running/Stopped (R19); Import YAML as a path field (R24); Status read-only (D10); no CI failing rung (D9).
Further accepted deviations: extend-only estimate; Jira row key only (R4); real xterm in the TUI pane with Take over confirm (D3); Workflow once step in the first branch (D12); quotePOSIX leaves safe words unquoted; wire owner "" for own commits, syntax errors carry line without a ✕ prefix, lastCommitAt in ms. Full list in plan section 6.4.

### v2.0 P150 Review code: per-branch review window, per-task review agent, GitHub viewed sync (Done)
P150 adds a per-branch Review code button that opens a dedicated review window reusing the Git module review module.
The since-review diff is content-based: the stored snapshot survives rebases and is pinned against cleanup.
The AI questions panel forwards to one interactive TUI Claude Code review session per task, via the Tracker.Send path.
GitHub sync is one-way: fully reviewed files are marked viewed via gh api graphql markFileAsViewed, and files the user un-reviews are unmarked via unmarkFileAsViewed, only if the app marked them.
The ▶ Review action uses the same review agent; renamed unchanged files keep their review; review windows are not restored on relaunch.
purgeReviewWindows runs at boot (main.go) to purge review windows on restart.
The git socket requires repo.open before use; the files pane now calls ensureRepoOpen, otherwise the error is 'repository not open'.
useDiffEditor (shared) holds Monaco objects in shallowRef, because a deep ref hung the page.
git-ui ReviewTarget gained an optional pane field, and setTarget(repoId, branch, {base, pane}) plus open let the review window resolve its target once.
A single-line reference renders as L<n>, not L<n>-<n>.
The GitHub sync reason for a rewritten, reviewed file is differsFromPrHead, not changedSinceReview.
In the sessions test fixture the review session rv01 is stopped, so two UI specs count it.
The closeDecision test covers the close/hide rule for review windows.

### v2.0 P151 Introduce mutation testing (report-only)
Mutation testing (P151) is report-only: no production edits, no new or fixed tests, no CI or hook gating.
The mutation testing CI workflow was removed by user decision (2026-10-07) as not worth the investment for now; mutation testing stays local-only via scripts/mutation/run.sh.
Mutation tooling lives under scripts/mutation/ and tools/mutation/; the plan is plans/P151-mutation-testing.md and the baseline is plans/P151-mutation-baseline.md.
User decisions for mutation testing: a single-maintainer bun runner is accepted, a sample baseline comes first with the full run later (resumable), container-gated adapters stay "not covered", and there is no root bun run mutation alias.
The mutation unit marker is <unit>.info.json (status, reason, duration, darwin files) rather than the mutation JSON, because red units have no mutation JSON. The TS layout is flat: ts/<area>.json|.log|.info.json.
tools/mutation/tsconfig.json ships in the summary commit, not the manifest commit, because an include of files that do not exist yet fails tsgo (TS18003).
Go mutation --changed does not use gremlins --diff because the snapshot has no .git; it limits packages to changed .go files and excludes every other file of the package with -E.
Workspace packages carry their own node_modules (isolated linker), which Stryker's sandbox does not link (Cannot find package 'zod'); the fix is inPlace: true on the disposable snapshot, with run.sh symlinking every node_modules.
The Stryker setup uses a progress-append-only reporter for visible progress, and keeps the bun timeout and preload workarounds from planning.
tools/mutation/node_modules (172 packages) has no copyleft licences: MIT 139, Apache-2.0 15, ISC 10, BSD-3-Clause 4, BlueOak-1.0.0 1, 0BSD 1, CC-BY-4.0 1 (caniuse-lite, data, dev-only).
gremlins v0.6.0 builds -cpu 2 as a single argv entry, so go test fails to start and every covered mutant counts as killed; this invalidated the first Go baseline.
On internal/mask, gremlins with the --test-cpu flag gave 105 killed / 0 lived; without it, 87 killed / 17 lived / 1 timeout. The flag was removed from scripts/mutation/go.sh.

### v2.0 P152 Fix intermittent gitsock integration test failure (Done)
The P152 gitsock flake had three root causes: the catfile ctx watcher closed a healthy process after a post-success cancel (RC1, gitclient/catfile), gitsock tests shared the real ~/.kira-space (RC2), and the test client assumed repo.changed order and read without deadlines (RC3).
The P152 flake showed as a different gitsock integration test failing each run with E_INTERNAL: read |0: file already closed; it passed alone and was worse under CPU load.
The RC1 fix in catfile/session.go stops the ctx watcher synchronously so a cancel after success cannot kill the session; regression test is TestSession_CancelAfterSuccessDoesNotKillProcess.
The RC1 regression test only fails on the unfixed code under CPU load (4 busy loops, -count=20); without load -count=5 passes because the window is too narrow.
gitsock tests isolate kira.db and review.db per test and never use the real KIRA_SPACE_HOME (main_test.go, isolatedRegistry, envGitsockHelperHome).
gitsock tests await repo.changed by kind with deadlines via awaitRepoChanged(kind) and queue events seen during requests, instead of assuming first-event order.
The only production change in P152 was catfile/session.go; no gitsock production file was touched.
wireFrame.String() in gitsock tests prints the server error text, so existing %+v failure messages name it.
In gitsock tests, goroutine readers and expect-closed reads call armReadDeadline rather than readRaw; the matrix_test.go cross-repo leakage check keeps its own 300 ms read deadline.
handshake_test.go clientReceive is not deadline-bounded because it uses an in-process net.Pipe with no socket.
In the broker, onEnqueued runs before the emit (pairing.go:187-202), so a test reading its subscriber slice right after onEnqueued races; TestBroker_QueuedCountChangeIsEmittedEvenBehindAPresentedHead now waits on a channel.
TestBroker_QueueBoundedAgainstUnlimitedEnqueue is deterministic (fake clock, no I/O) and leaked 200 goroutines, fixed by releasing queued broker goroutines in pairing tests.
The cause of the earlier 10-minute gitsock test hang was not reproduced; the likely causes are a serial test blocked on a deadline-less read (RC3) or a SQLITE_BUSY-stalled shared DB (RC2).
Fix flaky tests by finding the root cause; never skip or retry them, and keep every RepoID/kind assertion.
23 test files in gitrpc, gitsession, ade and bridge still call gitsession.NewRegistry without overriding Review, so they open the real ~/.kira-space/review.db (ade/bridge likely also kira.db); this is the same RC2 class, outside P152 ownership, and two of those packages are owned by P146.
Recommended follow-up after P146 lands: a per-package TestMain setting KIRA_SPACE_HOME, or a shared testx helper, to isolate the real home in the remaining test packages.

### v2.0 P153 Fix `internal/terminal` TestSessionCloseKillsProcessGroup failure (Done)
TestSessionCloseKillsProcessGroup in internal/terminal failed because it treated an orphaned zombie as alive: kill(pid,0) succeeds on zombies, so it waited on PID 1's reap latency and failed past 4s. It also had a SIGHUP-during-fork race.
TestSessionCloseKillsProcessGroup now checks process state (/proc on Linux, ps off Linux) instead of kill(pid,0), and waits for the job to exec.
On Linux, creack/pty Fd() made the pty master blocking, so the ptmx.Close() fallback in Close never unblocked readLoop; this production Close bug was fixed. Darwin behavior is unchanged.
Jobs outside the shell's process group still survive terminal Session Close; tracked in phase P157.

### v2.0 P154 Isolate tests from the real `review.db` (Done)
Before P154, four packages resolved the default KIRA_SPACE_HOME in tests: ade, gitrpc and gitsession (via NewRegistry), and gitreview (via ensureOpen), so tests touched the real review.db.
testx.RunWithTempHomes runs in each affected package's TestMain so tests use temporary app homes instead of the real ones.
kirapaths.Home panics in a test binary when the KIRA_SPACE_HOME env var is unset, failing any test binary that resolves an app home from $HOME.
Terminal tests run under a temp HOME (testx.RunWithTempUserHome, internal/terminal/main_test.go) so pty bash does not write the real ~/.bash_history.
gitreview.Store.ensureOpen lays out the store's own directory via config.EnsureLayoutAt(filepath.Dir(s.path)) rather than the default home.
Never set KIRA_HOME in kira-space tests; none do today.

### v2.0 P155 Remove the dead `ade.allAgentsFilter` settings leaf (Done)
P155 removed the dead ade.allAgentsFilter settings leaf from the Go model, repo, validation, zod schema, defaults, bindings and two unit fixtures.
Migration 0013 deletes the stored ade.allAgentsFilter settings row, following migrations 0025, 0028 and 0029; P156 moves to migration 0014.
Removing the allAgentsFilter leaf left the wire contract (adewire, 53 methods) untouched.

### v2.0 P156 Persist held fix runs' resume spec across restart (Done)
The send-back launch spec (note, resume id, prompt, extra) is stored in four launch_* columns of `ade_runs` (migration `0014`), written at insert and cleared at launch, instead of the in-memory `runOpts` map.
A held fix run survives `Recover()` and resumes the target step's Claude session when its gate opens.
`RetryRun` of a stopped, never-launched run (StartedAt == nil) copies the persisted launch spec to the new run.
Running runs still go `stuck` on recovery, with no auto-resume (decision D7).
The wire contract (`adewire`, 53 methods) is unchanged by P156.
The launch spec rides the run row as `runOpts.Launch` (`model.AdeRunLaunch`); `TaskBoard.runOpts`, `setRunOpts` and `takeRunOpts` were removed.
`launch` clears the persisted spec in the same `UpdateRun` call that sets the run to `running`.
`TestRunEngine_recoverHeldFixRun` (runengine_wave4_test.go) covers recovery of a held fix run; impl attempt 1 is launched for real under the fake claude (scenario `sleep`) and stopped, because `RetrySetup` needs a real worktree and Claude id.
After migration 0014 the database is at version 14 with four launch_* columns defaulting to ''; before it was at version 13 without them.
Every `ade_runs` column list uses `adeRunColumns`.

### v2.0 P157 Terminal `Close`: keep shell-forwarding job semantics, end the session when the shell exits (Done)
Terminal session Close keeps shell-forwarding job semantics: no session sweep, so jobs the shell does not hang up (dash, disown, nohup) outlive the tab, as in VS Code, tmux and kitty.
A session sweep was rejected because it cannot tell a disowned job from a dash job.
On Linux the terminal session ends exitDrain (200 ms) after the shell exits, so a surviving job holding the pty no longer stalls Close for 4 s or keeps a shell-exited tab open. Darwin is unchanged.
The terminal process-group test is pinned to bash/zsh; the per-shell forwarding subtests skip only when the shell binary is absent.
On darwin the pty master stays blocking, so the exitDrain close cannot interrupt the read; ARCHITECTURE tracks this as an open item. The darwin behavior is untested.
Never run terminal tests under nohup; use setsid instead, because nohup makes SIGHUP ignored in the test binary and bash/dash and their jobs inherit it, causing spurious Close failures.

### v2.0 P158 Drop headless todo progress (Done)
Only the workflow's own steps count as progress; agent todo progress and any progress built on agent-internal state were removed (user decision, final).
Todo progress was removed end to end: wire (Run.todo), stream-json todo parsing in internal/adeagent, OnTodo/setTodo handler, ade_runs.todo_* columns, panel readouts and todo-only tests. Step progress stays.
A running run counts 0 toward progress.
Migration 0015 rebuilds ade_runs to drop the todo_* columns; it preserves existing run rows (including launch_* fields) and keeps the ade_runs_task and ade_runs_state indexes.
Removing Run.todo from the wire is a rule-1 contract change, done as serial step 0, with fixtures board.json and event-runs.json updated.
After the change, percent of T_search is 60 (was 67), matching the parity oracle on the edited mockup.
TodoWrite remains only in testdata/taskcreate.jsonl; todo_done/todo_total remain only in a comment in migrations 0008/0015.
The panel run line shows running then done with glyph ✓ and no mini bar, asserted by the mock-runtime UI spec.

### v2.0 P160 Fix HTTP response viewer freeze on large bodies; default max response 5 MB (Done)
MonacoHost caps its pending pre element at 16,384 characters, because a full-document pre forced the profiled layout inside editor.create.
MonacoHost creates the Monaco model empty and then fills it, chunked for large read-only documents, instead of building it with the full document.
The HTTP response body is formatted once, in a worker.
The default api.maxResponseMb is 5 (lowered from 50 by user decision), because for an API client 5 MB is already enormous.
The freeze on large HTTP response bodies came from Monaco _createConfiguration/measureReferenceDomElement running after MonacoHost.vue built the model with the full document.
ResponsePane.vue ran beautifyJson twice per receive (prettyFormat and bodyText), about 1.1 s each at 12 MB; the fix is to parse once.
For a 12 MB JSON response, the fix cut the longest main-thread block from 8152 to 325 ms, time to show from 9.0 to 2.4 s, and RSS delta from 1736 to 617 MB.
The response viewer perf probe is tests/perf/http-response.spec.ts (WebKit). Acceptance requires re-running it for json, text-80col, text-short-lines and text-1line before and after, and recording the numbers in the plan's ## Result.

### v2.0 P161 Documents view: dropped frames on the fastest flick
Documents view profiling of the fastest flick: two reka tooltips per row cost about 51 ms of a 142 ms frame; 8-row overscan at 160 px rows was also a hot spot.
The Documents view uses a shared row tooltip and pixel-based overscan instead of per-row tooltips and row-count overscan, cutting flick frame p95 from 171 to 66 ms and ladder p95 from 68 to 39 ms.
The P161 target of flick frame p95 <= 50 ms was not met (66 ms); closing the rest needs scroll-time placeholders, a user call tracked as an ARCHITECTURE open item.
The Documents grid scroll budget is 16 / 80 ms.
Baseline (WebKit, 5000 documents, ~160 px rows, 800000 px list): fastest wheel flick gave frame p95 103 ms, max 136 ms, 45 of 82 frames over 50 ms; the standard momentum ladder was fine at about 55 fps.
Do not fix scroll performance without a profile that names the cause; accept only with the probe documents-scroll.spec.ts plus the fastest-flick case measured before and after.

### v2.0 P162 Grid canvas layer fix: Studio data/console grids and git graph
The 20-column data grid performance gap in headless WPE is caused by per-row compositing layers: runway rows overlap the header strip's will-change layer and, with no stacking context on .grid-canvas, each row gets its own layer rebuilt on every row mount.
Canvas contain: layout paint is applied to the grid canvas in slickTheme.css (Studio data and console grids) and in packages/git-ui CommitGrid.vue (git graph, also the VS Code webview) to stop per-row compositing layers.
On the git graph CommitGrid the contain rule is applied as the same row-layer guard although there is no header strip there; no perf measurement was made (user decision).
Keep the grid header will-change (it is the P22 flicker fix) and the cell borders, since no cheaper construct was measured. No overscan, runway JS or content-visibility change was made.
With the contain fix in headless WPE (NCOLS=20), the data grid went from 34 to 52 fps, p95 from 63 to 28 ms, frames over 50 ms from about 600 to 1, and scroll RSS rise from about 225 to 112 MB.
With the contain fix in headless WPE (NCOLS=20), the console grid went from 42 to 61 fps and p95 from 45 to 18 ms.
Canvas migration was dropped from P162 and moved to P165.
P162 was rescoped from "confirm and reduce per-frame cost (20 columns)" to the grid layer fix after the bisect.
Built CSS carries .slick-grid-host .grid-canvas{contain:layout paint} in the Studio dist and .kv-commit-grid .grid-canvas{contain:layout paint} in the Space and VS Code webview bundles.
Run the perf probe with the regex tests/perf/(console-)?grid-scroll, because the filter grid-scroll also matches proto-grid-scroll.spec.ts and adds about 3 minutes per run.
Run Playwright via node_modules/.bin/playwright, because bare playwright resolves to a global binary with a version mismatch (error: "test() not expected").
bun run lint:dead exits 0 and prints only "Duplicate exports" notes (deliberate same-value aliases such as BASE_LEAD_PX/OVERSCAN_PX) and knip config hints, with no unused export.
Mac A/B toggles use the kiraAB helper to turn off D1 (Studio grids) with .slick-grid-host .grid-canvas{contain:none !important} and D4 (Space git graph, VS Code webview) with .kv-commit-grid .grid-canvas{contain:none !important}.
Mac A/B protocol per toggle: check the Layers tab count, Activity Monitor footprint over 10 s of scroll, and __kiraScrollTrace gapFrames/uncoveredMax/frameP95 over one hard flick; for the graph also check seams, HEAD ring, badges, hover and menu.

### v2.0 P163 Shared parse worker and chunker for large payloads (Done)
P163 added a shared parse Web Worker at workers/parse/ and a shared chunker at editor/chunkedText.ts; P160's prettyBody* functions were folded into the worker.
Moving console Format to the shared parse worker cut the main-thread block from 1848 ms to 187 ms at 236 KB.
Moving request/gRPC Beautify to the worker cut a 5 MB JSON from 1420 ms to 1021 ms; the remainder is the Monaco write.
Moving console Mongo Copy all to the worker cut it from 411 ms to 83 ms at 10,000 documents.
Documents field names are memoized.
Parsing for large payloads stays in the frontend; Go-side formatting is out of scope for P163.
The shared worker design: a typed request set, one handler per format (JSON, XML, others found), a lazy-start composable, main-thread fallback, and cancellation.
The shared chunker, generalised from P160's chunked fill, handles chunk size, frame pacing, cancellation and line alignment, and is used wherever large data is pushed into a UI or editor.
Callers migrate to the shared worker one commit each, measured before and after on the perf probe (quiet gate, median of 3); a caller with negligible cost is listed as "no change" with its numbers.
P163 starts after P161 lands, because they share Documents files.

### v2.0 P164 Small UI fixes: status bar, new connection, ADE user steps, SQL filter colours (Done)
The shared status bar renders its left group only when the left-extra slot is filled; the right group uses ml-auto.
The "no selection" status item and Kira Studio's engine-status item were removed, along with workbench/state/engine.ts, the dead Go EngineService/engineStatus, its registration, bridge call, test mocks and ARCHITECTURE mention.
In the New connection dialog, binding :data-off="!SUPPORTED_KINDS.has(kind)" rendered data-off="false" because Vue keeps false on non-boolean attributes, and Tailwind data-[off] matches attribute presence, so every tile got opacity-40, cursor-default and no hover.
For Tailwind data-attribute variants in Vue, bind undefined rather than false when the attribute should be absent, because the variant matches attribute presence.
The New connection dialog's Step 1/Step 2 breadcrumbs were removed; a UI test in connection-dialog-tabs.spec.ts covers the greyed-tile bug.
In ADE flows, the prompt is optional on a session: true user stage (adeflow/parse.go); other stage kinds still require one, and the writer omits the prompt key when empty.
The ADE run engine handles an empty user-step prompt: composeStageMessage always sends the header lines and skips an empty prompt, and compose.ts guards the same.
AutocompleteField paints filter text via monaco.editor.colorize(), which uses the global Monaco theme; defineKiraTheme previously only defined kira-editor, so the global theme stayed light vs until an editor mounted, giving dark-on-dark WHERE/ORDER BY text.
defineKiraTheme now calls setTheme(KIRA_EDITOR_THEME) at definition, so the filter inputs and SQL console share one theme built from the --kira-syntax-* tokens (VS Code Dark+ values), with no second colour table.
The app is dark-only (no light theme exists).

### v2.0 P165 Cheetah Grid prototype for the SQL data grid
P165 (Cheetah Grid prototype for the SQL data grid) ended NO-GO: canvas grid migration dropped, SlickGrid stays (with the P162 layer fix).
In a user comparison on a real Mac, Cheetah Grid showed no visible smoothness gain over SlickGrid and worse memory (larger spike, slower return to baseline); user-reported, G3 gate never run.
The Cheetah Grid prototype code is kept as a comparison tool; the gates are in the plan's Result section.
The canvas grid was prototyped in parallel with P162's SlickGrid fixes because those fixes may not improve performance enough.
The prototype library was Cheetah Grid (cheetah-grid + vue-cheetah-grid, MIT, Vue 3), chosen over Glide, rejected because it is a React island.
The prototype is standalone, not wired into the app's data views, runnable on a real Mac, and uses the same 10 000 rows x 20 mixed-type columns as the NCOLS=20 probe.
The prototype had to show or honestly report each current grid feature per the parity checklist in plans/P162-canvas-grid-investigation.md section 4; the accessibility overlay was excluded by user decision.
The prototype had to prove Playwright can drive it via a debug hook exposing cell geometry, values, selection and editor, plus a support/grid.ts-style helper over that hook.
The comparison against SlickGrid used the perf probe flick ladder (fps, p95, RSS) and the late-data symptom (uncovered pixels during fast flicks).
P165 was added at the end by user request without renumbering other phases, and is independent of P162's SlickGrid work.

### v2.0 P166 Code review round 1 of 2 (Done)
Code review phases follow CLAUDE.md "Code review": one Opus reviewer covers architecture/structure/maintainability/security, functional correctness and business logic, and performance and resource efficiency, and only reports.
The code review reviewer writes findings to docs/v2.0/plans/P166-code-review.md, states the base commit, and commits the file before any fixer starts.
After review, one sequential Sonnet fixer commits per group of related findings (same file, module or root cause); the findings file is deleted once every finding is fixed.
Code review acceptance: hooks green on every commit; each finding is fixed or, if it needs a real design decision, becomes its own named SPEC.md phase. CodeGraph discovery is mandatory.
P166 scope was everything changed since the last review session P142 (last fix commit 743af03); P143-P165 were unreviewed. Round 2 plans against the tree round 1 leaves.
P166 review found 9 findings (medium 3, low 6) against base 743af03; all held on re-read and were fixed by one sequential fixer, one commit per group.
Fix F5 added a debounced board refetch on run events and scoped the run read to live tasks (RunsByLiveTask/RunsOfTask).
Fix F1+F4: an archiving flag rejects launches with a mutex drain, and review state is purged after worktree removal.
Fix F7: GitHub sync keeps ledger rows when the PR file list is truncated.
Fix F6: a moved TUI session resumes by conversation id at the gate cwd.
Fix F8: a goTracked wait group tracks env-script and TUI-finish goroutines so no write happens after cancel.
Fix F3 focuses the existing review window instead of opening another; F2 changed a test that used a missing /repo path to use t.TempDir() while keeping the production stat.
F5 took only the reviewer's cheap bound, and F1 has no new test because a counter guard falls under the CLAUDE.md test bar.
P166 did not review every ADE v2 Vue component, board timeline/needsYou/calendar, dialog compose/flow/deliver, notes code, Space bridge/index.ts, git-ui review changes, packages/workbench pieces, Studio documents scroll, grid layer fix, console copyAll/resultMenu, gRPC/HTTP body panes, mutation and codegraph-duplicates tooling, or check-ade-colours.sh; these are open for P167.
P166 only skimmed ade/{board_facts,gitfacts,integration,board_writes}.go, adeflow/parse.go, adeagent/stream.go, adewire/wire.go, the frontend board model, gitsession/incremental.go and ADE repos. Landed P168 commits inside the P167 diff are reviewed under P168.

### v2.0 P167 Code review round 2 of 2 (Done)
Estimates are capped at 480h and 60 days in Go validation; a stored over-cap estimate can be replaced; the Plan span is clamped to 60 days.
The sync-plan invalidation on every board push was dropped because the push-driven refetch caused the problem; the plan reloads on focus, mark, apply and popover open.
F2 has no PullFiles cache, because the head sha is known only after the fetch.
launchGate has an archive guard at its top; applyTUIFinish and goTracked respect shutdown; the MCP server stops before wg.Wait.
RecordMerge checks ancestry only (branch tip must be an ancestor of the target), so a squash or cherry-pick merge is refused there; the board still auto-detects them via saveMark. It accepts a merge in the unpushed local target.
Integration git facts are cached by the branch tip pair.
The per-second tick runs only while a setup is running.
Past off/extra days are skipped and pruned.
Review code has an onError handler; channel names for ADE tasks live under CHANNEL.adeTask*.

### v2.0 P168 Part 1 Whole-codebase code review pre-plan, chunking and stream assignment (Done)
The P168 whole-codebase review runs under a hard cap of 2 concurrent agent streams across everything; the P166/P167 chain holds 1 slot until P167 is committed, so only Stream A runs until then (phase 1) and both streams run after (phase 2).
Each P168 stream worktree must rebase onto v2.0 before landing each chunk; on a real conflict, re-read against the current tree and never resolve blindly.
Every P168 chunk review plan must re-read the current files (plan §3.4).
P168 deliberately deviates from CLAUDE.md's "Code review" recipe, as P108 did, and the deviation is not to be generalized: one Opus reviewer per chunk with a freeform "any kind of issue or bug" brief weighting edge cases, instead of three dimension reviewers.
The P168 pre-plan is done by one Opus planner who splits the whole tree (both apps, internal/**, packages/**, scripts, hooks, tests) into cohesive chunks, each its own files plus one hop out on both call-graph edges, re-surveyed on the tree P167 leaves rather than reusing P108's chunk list.
The P168 planner must make codegraph_explore calls (CodeGraph), and they must be verified in the planner's run.
The P168 planner assigns chunks to at most 2 parallel streams, each with its own worktree and zero file-ownership overlap, with gates for cross-stream dependencies, and appends one "P168 Part N: <chunk>" row per chunk in execution order to the table, each pointing at the plan's section.
Per-chunk P168 workflow, one chunk at a time within a stream: Opus writes the chunk review plan; one Opus reviewer writes findings to plans/P168-part<N>-findings.md and commits before any fixer; one Sonnet fixer commits per group of related findings; then the findings file is deleted.
P168 acceptance: hooks green on every commit; every finding fixed or, if it needs a real design decision, made its own named SPEC.md phase; a chunk with nothing real says so.
The P168 pre-plan produced 22 chunks as Parts 2-23: Stream A (Studio plus both shared bases) takes Parts 2-13 and Stream B (Space) takes Parts 14-23. Part rows added by the pre-plan keep the P168 number.

### v2.0 P168 Part 2 Studio persistence, secrets and connection lifecycle (Done)
P168 Part 2 (Studio persistence, secrets and connection lifecycle) owns apps/kira-studio/internal/{storage,secrets,localauth,connections,preconnect,datagrip}/**.
Callers one hop from P168 Part 2 packages: every adapter and testsupport (storage/model), adapterhost, bridge, dbmcp, enginecache, oplog, tree, postman, apivars, maskrules, appcore, ipcfixture, and main.go openCore.
Callees one hop from P168 Part 2 packages: internal/{appsettings,appstorage,sqlitex,kiratime,ipcerr}, httpclient, and the adapter registry.
P168 Part 2 packages sit at the bottom of Studio's Go call graph with zero P166-scope churn, so it opens phase 1 with the least collision risk.
Per-chunk loop (plan §6): one Opus reviewer with no separate plan step (CLAUDE.md); findings go to plans/P168-part2-findings.md and are committed before the Sonnet fixer; fixes are committed per related group; the findings file is deleted; the chunk lands (§3.4) before the next chunk.
The first chunk's review plan re-runs plan §8 and records drift.

### v2.0 P168 Part 3 Studio DB adapters I: adapter core and SQL engines (Done)
P168 Part 3 (Studio DB adapters I: adapter core and SQL engines) is Stream A, position 2; its plan is docs/v2.0/plans/P168-prep-plan.md §5.2.
P168 Part 3 owns apps/kira-studio/internal/adapters/*.go, the adapters subpackages testsupport, relational, postgres, mysqlfamily, mysql, mariadb, sqlite and clickhouse, scripts/demo-dbs/**, scripts/db-compat.sh and scripts/test-matrix.sh.
P168 Part 3 reaches one hop out to adapterhost, dbmcp, tree, connections, bridge, ipcfixture and wireAdapters in main.go; its callees are storage/model, page, internal/jsonx and the drivers.
Conformance suites keep per-capability coverage (exemption stated in CLAUDE.md).
Each P168 chunk follows the plan §6 loop: one Opus reviewer with no separate plan step; findings go to plans/P168-part3-findings.md and are committed before the Sonnet fixer runs; fixes are committed per related group; the findings file is deleted; the chunk lands (§3.4) before the next chunk starts.

### v2.0 P168 Part 4 Studio DB adapters II: document, key-value, stream, object-store engines (Done)
P168 Part 4 (Studio DB adapters II) covers the document, key-value, stream and object-store engines: mongo, redis, kafka, sqs, s3 and awscfg.
P168 Part 4 owns the code under apps/kira-studio/internal/adapters/{mongo,redis,kafka,sqs,s3,awscfg}/**.
P168 Part 4 is Stream A, position 3; its plan is in docs/v2.0/plans/P168-prep-plan.md section 5.3.
P168 Part 4 has the same callers as Part 3; its callees are Part 3's core, storage/model, page and the SDK clients. The conformance suites are kept.
Each P168 Part 4 chunk follows the per-chunk loop from plan section 6: one Opus reviewer, no separate plan step (per CLAUDE.md). Findings go to plans/P168-part4-findings.md and are committed before the Sonnet fixer runs.
In the P168 Part 4 loop, fixes are committed per related group and the findings file is deleted. The chunk must land (plan section 3.4) before the next chunk starts.
The Part 3 adapter core is settled, and Part 4 causes zero P166-scope churn.

### v2.0 P168 Part 5 Studio engine data plane and page wire protocol (Done)
P168 Part 5 (studio engine data plane and page wire protocol) is Stream A, position 4; plan is docs/v2.0/plans/P168-prep-plan.md §5.4.
P168 Part 5 owns apps/kira-studio/internal/{adapterhost,enginecache,page,tree,oplog,ipcfixture}/** (page/wire is generated and excluded).
P168 Part 5 also owns packages/shared/protocol/** except events.ts and generated wire/, shared/domain/{mutations,object-store,tree,connection}.ts, packages/db-fixtures/**, and frontend/src/bridge/**.
P168 Part 5 owns tests/{ipc,e2e-real,support}/** (e2e-real is kept) and tests/unit/{bridge-*,e2e-real-build-lock}.
P168 Part 5 reviews one hop out: the Go bridge, dbmcp, appshell, appcore, main.go, every TS store/view calling bridge/{data,control,apiControl}.ts, and the callees adapters, storage, connections and @workbench/bridge.
Each P168 chunk follows a per-chunk loop (plan §6): one Opus reviewer with no separate plan step (per CLAUDE.md), findings written to plans/P168-part5-findings.md and committed before the Sonnet fixer runs, fixes committed per related group, findings file deleted, then the chunk lands (§3.4).
Both halves of the page wire mirror are handled in one chunk of P168 Part 5, because the callees (Parts 2-4) are settled.

### v2.0 P168 Part 6 Studio Go app shell, Wails bridge and DB MCP (Done)
P168 Part 6 covers the Studio Go app shell, Wails bridge and DB MCP, and is Stream A position 5 of P168.
P168 Part 6 owns apps/kira-studio/internal/{bridge,appshell,appcore,buildinfo,config,dbmcp,queryplan,mask,maskrules,mcpauth,mcpinstall}/**, internal/layering_test.go, main.go, Taskfile.yml, .gitignore, cmd/**, build/**, shared/domain/{mask,dbmcp}.ts and tests/unit/mask-parity.spec.ts.
P168 Part 6 is a hub over every Studio Go service, so it is reviewed after them; its callees are Parts 2-5, Part 7 and root internal/*, and its one-hop callers are Wails-bound frontend stores and MCP clients.
Per-chunk review loop (plan §6): one Opus reviewer with no separate plan step (CLAUDE.md); findings go to plans/P168-part6-findings.md and are committed before the Sonnet fixer runs; fixes are committed per related group; the findings file is then deleted; the chunk lands (§3.4) before the next chunk.
The P168 Part 6 plan is in docs/v2.0/plans/P168-prep-plan.md §5.5.

### v2.0 P168 Part 7 Studio API client backend (Done)
P168 Part 7 (Studio API client backend) owns apps/kira-studio/internal/{httpclient,grpcclient,apivars,postman}/**, packages/api-core/**, shared/domain/{http,collections,grpc,grpc-history,response-history,variables}.ts, and tests/unit/go-ts-vocabulary-parity.spec.ts.
P168 Part 7 is Stream A, position 6; its plan is docs/v2.0/plans/P168-prep-plan.md §5.6.
Each P168 chunk follows the per-chunk loop in plan §6: one Opus reviewer with no separate plan step (per CLAUDE.md), findings written to plans/P168-part7-findings.md and committed before the Sonnet fixer runs, fixes committed per related group, findings file deleted, and the chunk landed (§3.4) before the next chunk.
P168 Part 7 is the last zero-churn chunk because the bridge callers (Part 6) are settled.
P168 Part 7 treats as one-hop dependencies the bridge http/grpc/collections/variables files, storage model/repos, frontend/src/api, views/{httprequest,grpcrequest}, and theme/src/methodColor.ts; callees are storage repos, secrets cipher, reveal authorizer, and localauth.

### v2.0 P168 Part 8 Shared Go base and repo tooling (Done)
P168 Part 8 (Shared Go base and repo tooling) is Stream A, position 7; Gate G1 holds Part 14 until it lands.
P168 Part 8 owns internal/** (26 packages), scripts/** except Part 3's and the two VS Code scripts, scripts/mutation/**, tools/mutation/**, .githooks/**, .claude/**, .github/workflows/* and every root config file.
Fixes to .github/workflows/* in P168 Part 8 go through docs/pending-workflows/.
P168 Part 8 reaches one hop out: every Go importer in both apps, both main.go files, and Space ADE (agenthooks, terminal, procgroup). Before Stream B starts, the fixer may edit Space callers (plan §3.3).
Per-chunk loop for P168 Part 8 (plan §6): one Opus reviewer with no separate plan step; findings go to plans/P168-part8-findings.md and are committed before the Sonnet fixer; fixes are committed per related group; the findings file is deleted; the chunk lands (§3.4) before the next chunk.
P168 Part 8 is placed after the six zero-churn Studio Go chunks because it has 2,011 lines of P166-scope churn (mutation tooling, terminal, shell), so it runs once most P166 fixes have landed.

### v2.0 P168 Part 9 Shared frontend base (Done)
P168 Part 9 (shared frontend base) is Stream A, position 8; Gate G2 holds Part 17 until it lands.
P168 Part 9 owns packages/workbench, packages/theme, packages/kira-ui, packages/shared/package.json, shared/protocol/events.ts, and shared/domain/{agent,base64,color,git,layout,ops,path,repo,scripts,settings,shortcuts,tabs}.ts.
P168 Part 9 one-hop scope covers both apps' frontends, git-ui, git-ipc, vscode and api-core; callees are Vue, reka-ui, VueUse, Pinia, TanStack Query and xterm.
Before Stream B starts, the P168 Part 9 fixer may edit Space callers.
Each P168 chunk follows the plan §6 loop: one Opus reviewer with no separate plan step (per CLAUDE.md); findings go to plans/P168-part9-findings.md and are committed before the Sonnet fixer; fixes are committed per related group; the findings file is deleted; the chunk lands (§3.4) before the next.
Every TS chunk in both apps one-hops into the shared frontend base, so Part 9 closes before any Studio TS view chunk and before Part 17.

### v2.0 P168 Part 10 Studio API client UI (Done)
P168 Part 10 (Studio API client UI) is in Stream C, position 1 of 4, moved from Stream A by user instruction (3 streams).
Stream C owns frontend/src/{api,views/httprequest,views/grpcrequest}/**, tests/unit/{api-*,grpc-*,http-*,history-runtime-*}, tests/ui/{http-*,grpc-*,collections,api-*,secrets,credential-reveal}, tests/perf/http-* and tests/visual/http-request-view*.
Part 10 may reach one hop out to workbench/tabViews.ts, App.vue and tab kinds; its callees are api-core, views/shared/request, editor, parse worker and state.
Route a fix that needs a Stream A-owned file to Stream A; Stream C must not make it, because callee Parts 7 and 9 were not yet reviewed.
Per-chunk review loop (plan §6): one Opus reviewer with no separate plan step (CLAUDE.md); findings go to plans/P168-part10-findings.md and are committed before the Sonnet fixer; fixes are committed per related group; the findings file is deleted; the chunk lands (§3.4) before the next chunk.
The plan for P168 Part 10 is in docs/v2.0/plans/P168-prep-plan.md §5.9.

### v2.0 P168 Part 11 Studio grid and shared view machinery (Done)
P168 Part 11 (studio grid and shared view machinery) is in Stream C, position 2 of 4, moved from Stream A by user instruction (3 streams).
In P168 Part 11, route a fix needing a Stream A-owned file to Stream A; Stream C must not make it, because callee Parts 7 and 9 are not yet reviewed.
P168 Part 11 owns frontend/src/views/{shared,grid}/**, grid/slick/page/row/cell unit specs, tests/ui/{slick-grid,data-view,cell-editor,mutations,row-coloring,scroll-trace,fake-data}, tests/perf/{grid-scroll,support/wideTable}, and tests/visual/data-view*.
P168 Part 11 reviews one hop: the console, grid, documents, stream, httprequest and grpcrequest views, plus callees state, bridge, protocol/page.ts and SlickGrid.
The P168 per-chunk loop (plan §6) uses one Opus reviewer with no separate plan step (per CLAUDE.md). Findings go to plans/P168-part11-findings.md and are committed before the Sonnet fixer runs. Fixes are committed per related group, then the findings file is deleted.
Land each chunk (§3.4) before starting the next chunk in P168 Part 11.
Part 11 is a callee of every data view, so it is reviewed before the console and per-kind views.
The plan for P168 Part 11 is in docs/v2.0/plans/P168-prep-plan.md §5.10.

### v2.0 P168 Part 12 Studio console, editor, parse worker and per-kind data views (Done)
P168 Part 12 covers the Studio console, editor, parse worker and per-kind data views.
P168 Part 12 is Stream C, position 3 of 4, moved from Stream A by user instruction (3 streams).
A fix in Part 12 that needs a Stream A-owned file is routed to Stream A, not made by Stream C, because callee Parts 7 and 9 are not yet reviewed.
Part 12 per-chunk loop (plan §6): one Opus reviewer with no separate plan step (CLAUDE.md); findings go to plans/P168-part12-findings.md and are committed before the Sonnet fixer; fixes are committed per related group; the findings file is deleted; the chunk lands (§3.4) before the next chunk.
Part 12 runs late because it carries 2,039 lines of P166-scope churn (parse worker, perf); the grid (Part 11) is settled.
Part 12 plan is at docs/v2.0/plans/P168-prep-plan.md §5.11. Stream C owns frontend/src/views/{console,documents,keyvalue,stream,browse,definition}/**, editor/**, workers/**, beautify.ts, and shared/domain/{sql-*,console,definition,editor,schema,queries,streamFilter}.ts.
Part 12 also owns tests/fixtures/**, console/sql/document/stream unit specs, console/autocomplete/sql-schema/definition UI specs, console/documents/parse perf specs, and console and schema-dialog visual specs.
Part 12 reaches one hop into tab views and httprequest/grpcrequest (editor, parse worker), and its callees are views/shared, state, Monaco, sql-formatter, and theme/completion.ts.

### v2.0 P168 Part 13 Studio shell, project tree, state stores and UI-test harness (Done)
P168 Part 13 covers the Studio shell, project tree, state stores and UI-test harness. It is Stream C, position 4 of 4 (moved from Stream A by user instruction, 3 streams).
In P168 Part 13, route a fix that needs a Stream A-owned file to Stream A; Stream C must not make it, because callee Parts 7 and 9 are not yet reviewed.
Part 13 owns the rest of apps/kira-studio/**: App.vue, main.ts, fonts.ts, frontend/src/{workbench,project,state,theme,shortcuts}/**, frontend and Playwright configs, shared/caps.ts, shared/domain/{mode,uri,tree-filter,datagrip,secrets}.ts, tests/ui/support/**, and the remaining unit/UI/visual/perf specs.
Part 13 has no hop above it (it is the app root); its callees are every Studio view, the bridge and the frontend base.
The per-chunk loop (plan §6) uses one Opus reviewer with no separate plan step (CLAUDE.md); findings go to plans/P168-part13-findings.md and are committed before the Sonnet fixer runs; fixes are committed per related group; the findings file is deleted; the chunk lands (§3.4) before the next chunk.
Part 13 is placed last on purpose (originally Stream A, now Stream C position 4 of 4) because state/** is every view's callee (bottom-up exception); earlier fixers may edit it and this pass re-reviews it settled.

### v2.0 P168 Part 14 Space git process layer (Done)
P168 Part 14 (Space git process layer) owns apps/kira-space/internal/{gitclient,ghclient,gitpath,gitaskpass}/**, including porcelain/testdata.
Part 14 one-hop dependents are gitsession, gitrpc, gitsock, gitsearch, gitpreflight, gitops, gitreview, gitprepare, codeworkspace, ade, bridge and main.go; callees are internal/{toolexec,pathsafe,localsock,kirapaths,procgroup} and the git and gh binaries.
Each P168 chunk follows the per-chunk loop (plan §6): one Opus reviewer with no separate plan step (per CLAUDE.md); findings go to plans/P168-part14-findings.md and are committed before the Sonnet fixer runs; fixes are committed per related group; the findings file is deleted; the chunk lands (§3.4) before the next chunk.
The Part 14 packages are at the bottom of Space's Go call graph, and porcelain parsing and askpass are edge-case and security heavy.
The plan for P168 Part 14 is in docs/v2.0/plans/P168-prep-plan.md §5.13.

### v2.0 P168 Part 15 Space git preflight, ops, review, search, prepare, graph store and op log (Done)
P168 Part 15 owns apps/kira-space/internal/{gitpreflight,gitops,gitreview,gitsearch,gitprepare,gitstore,oplog}/**; gitwire is generated and excluded.
P168 Part 15 is Stream B, position 2; its plan is docs/v2.0/plans/P168-prep-plan.md §5.14.
Part 15 one-hop packages are gitsession, gitrpc, gitsock, ade and adeagent; its callees are Part 14 and internal/{sqlitex,notify,kiratime}.
gitstore/encode.go must mirror git-ipc graphChunkCodec.ts (Part 17).
Part 15 uses the per-chunk loop from plan §6: one Opus reviewer with no separate plan step (per CLAUDE.md); findings go to plans/P168-part15-findings.md and are committed before the Sonnet fixer; fixes are committed per related group; the findings file is deleted; the chunk lands (§3.4) before the next chunk.

### v2.0 P168 Part 16 Space git session (Done)
P168 Part 16 (Space git session) owns apps/kira-space/internal/gitsession/** and is Stream B, position 3.
P168 Part 16 touches one hop of neighbours: gitrpc, gitsock, ade, bridge and main.go; its callees are Parts 14-15 and storage/model.
P168 Part 16 follows the per-chunk loop (plan §6): one Opus reviewer with no separate plan step (per CLAUDE.md), findings written to plans/P168-part16-findings.md and committed before the Sonnet fixer runs, fixes committed per related group, findings file deleted, and the chunk landed (§3.4) before the next chunk.
The plan for P168 Part 16 is in docs/v2.0/plans/P168-prep-plan.md section 5.15.

### v2.0 P168 Part 17 Space git RPC, socket server and `git-ipc` contract (Done)
Part 17 of P168 covers the Space git RPC, the socket server and the git-ipc contract, and is in Stream B at position 4.
Gate G2: Part 17 starts only after Part 9 has landed.
Part 17 owns apps/kira-space/internal/{gitrpc,gitsock,gitvsix}/** and packages/git-ipc/**, with src/generated excluded.
Part 17 reviews one hop out: Go bridge/{gitstream,gitclients}.go and main.go; TS git-ui, frontend/src/{repo,views/repo} and vscode; callees are Part 16, storage, and internal/{rpcstream,notify,ipcerr,tokenauth}.
Each chunk follows the per-chunk loop (plan §6): one Opus reviewer with no separate plan step; findings go to plans/P168-part17-findings.md and are committed before the Sonnet fixer; fixes are committed per related group; the findings file is deleted; and the chunk lands (§3.4) before the next chunk.
Part 17 holds both halves of the git RPC contract in one chunk. It is the first Stream B chunk with TS, because git-ipc imports @workbench.

### v2.0 P168 Part 18 `git-core` and `git-ui` logic (Done)
P168 Part 18 covers git-core and git-ui logic, sits in Stream B at position 5, and is Done.
P168 Part 18 owns packages/git-core/**, packages/git-ui/src/{state,graph,bridge}/**, and git-ui/src/{index.ts,graphVisibility.ts,shims-vue.d.ts}.
P168 Part 18 one-hop scope is git-ui components and App.vue, Space repo/views/repo, and vscode; the callee is git-ipc.
The P168 per-chunk loop (plan §6) uses one Opus reviewer with no separate plan step (per CLAUDE.md). Findings go to plans/P168-part18-findings.md and are committed before the Sonnet fixer runs. Fixes are committed per related group, then the findings file is deleted. The chunk must land (§3.4) before the next chunk.
The plan for P168 Part 18 is in docs/v2.0/plans/P168-prep-plan.md §5.17.
git-ipc (Part 17) is settled.

### v2.0 P168 Part 19 `git-ui` components (Done)
P168 Part 19 covers the rest of packages/git-ui (src/components, App.vue, MountRoot.vue, main.ts, icons, lib, theme, testing, configs) and is Stream B, position 6.
P168 Part 19 reaches one hop out to frontend/src/repo/git/gitUiModule.ts, views/repo and the vscode webview; its callees are Part 18 and the frontend base.
Each P168 chunk follows the per-chunk loop from plan §6: one Opus reviewer with no separate plan step; findings go to plans/P168-part19-findings.md and are committed before the Sonnet fixer runs; fixes are committed per related group; the findings file is deleted; the chunk is landed (§3.4) before the next chunk.
The P168 Part 19 plan is in docs/v2.0/plans/P168-prep-plan.md §5.18.
The logic in Part 18 is settled before Part 19 begins.

### v2.0 P168 Part 20 Space ADE engine (Go) and Space persistence (Done)
P168 Part 20 covers the Space ADE engine (Go) and Space persistence.
P168 Part 20 owns apps/kira-space/internal/{ade,adeflow,adeagent,storage}/** and internal/bridge/{adetask.go,adetask_validate.go,agentsessions.go,adewire/**}.
Each P168 chunk follows the same per-chunk loop (plan §6): one Opus reviewer with no separate plan step, findings written to plans/P168-part20-findings.md and committed before the Sonnet fixer runs, fixes committed per related group, the findings file deleted, and the chunk landed (§3.4) before the next chunk.
ADE calls the git layer one way only, so Part 20 is ordered after the git layer.

### v2.0 P168 Part 21 Space ADE frontend and review window (Done)
P168 Part 21 (Space ADE frontend and review window) is in Stream C, after Part 13; moved from Stream B by user instruction for load balancing.
P168 Part 21 owns apps/kira-space/frontend/src/ade/**, tests/ui/{ade-v2-*,support/adeV2.ts}, tests/unit/{ade*,support/adeV2Fixtures.ts,support/mockupV2Oracle.ts} and tests/fixtures/ade-v2/**.
P168 Part 21 touches App.vue (AdeReviewWindow) and workbench as one-hop files; its callees are frontend/src/bridge, repo/git/transport.ts (Part 22, a bottom-up exception) and @workbench.
The ADE wire mirror in the Part 21 frontend is checked against adewire (Part 20), whose Go half is settled.
Each P168 chunk follows the same loop (plan §6): one Opus reviewer with no separate plan step (per CLAUDE.md), findings written to plans/P168-part21-findings.md and committed before the Sonnet fixer, fixes committed per related group, findings file deleted, chunk landed (§3.4) before the next chunk.

### v2.0 P168 Part 22 Kira Space desktop host (Done)
P168 Part 22 (Kira Space desktop host) moved from Stream B to Stream A, after Part 9, by user instruction for load balancing.
P168 Part 22 owns the rest of apps/kira-space/**: internal/{bridge (rest),appshell,appcore,codeworkspace,config,buildinfo}/**, internal/layering_test.go, main.go, Taskfile.yml, build/**, configs, frontend/src/** except ade/, and remaining tests.
Part 22 is the app root with no hop above it; its callees are Parts 14-21 and both bases, so it is reviewed after everything it wires.
Per-chunk loop for Part 22 (plan §6): one Opus reviewer with no separate plan step; findings go to plans/P168-part22-findings.md and are committed before the Sonnet fixer; fixes are committed per related group; the findings file is deleted; the chunk lands (§3.4) before the next chunk.
The plan for P168 Part 22 is in docs/v2.0/plans/P168-prep-plan.md §5.21.

### v2.0 P168 Part 23 Kira Space VS Code extension (Done)
P168 Part 23 (Kira Space VS Code extension) is in Stream C, after Part 21, moved from Stream B by user instruction for load balancing.
P168 Part 23 owns apps/kira-space-vscode/**, scripts/build-vscode.ts and scripts/package-vscode.ts.
The Kira Space VS Code extension is one hop from VS Code activation, with callees git-ipc, git-core, git-ui and @theme.
Per-chunk loop for P168 parts (plan §6): one Opus reviewer, no separate plan step; findings go to plans/P168-part23-findings.md and are committed before the Sonnet fixer; fixes are committed per related group; the findings file is deleted; the chunk lands (§3.4) before the next chunk.
The Kira Space VS Code extension is the second git-ui host, and every package it consumes is settled.

### v2.0 P169 `gh` REST responses over 4 MiB are reported as unreadable (Done)
Before P169, the ghclient runner truncated gh output at 4 MiB and reported the cut JSON as "unreadable response", which large PRs with very large file or review lists could hit.
Architecture decision D4: no --jq for gh calls; P169 left D4 unchanged.
P169 chose option C: a 64 MiB cap enforced while reading gh output, with Result.StdoutTruncated and a forbidden status carrying a too-large reason.
A GraphQL call that exits 0 with non-JSON output is no longer treated as OK.
Acceptance for P169: a large-PR fixture over 4 MiB parses or reports a specific too-large status, and valid JSON never yields "unreadable response".
TestOpenPulls_LargePage builds a 100-item page over 4 MiB in the test and runs it through the real execRunner with a fake gh.
The real size of large gh responses is not yet measured; a follow-up (gh api ... | wc -c and time on open-PR pages) is tracked as a Known open item in ARCHITECTURE.md.

### v2.0 P170 Code review of P168 fixes, one round
P170 is a single delta code review round over the P168 fixes, diffing f40cd35..HEAD (f40cd35 is the state at P168's start); a second round runs only if the user asks.
P170 review starts only after every P168 part is landed and the P168 close-out is done.
P170 reviewers are Opus with no separate planner and CodeGraph mandatory; they only report, write plans/P170-part<N>-findings.md, and commit per block. Sonnet fixers follow.
Each P170 reviewer reads only fixer-changed code plus one hop, focusing on concurrency, security and data-loss fixes (Parts 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 17, 18), regressions, fixes that only silenced a symptom, and tests added by fixers.
P170 has four review areas, with findings files plans/P170-<area>-findings.md: studio-go (Parts 2-8), space-go (Parts 14-16, 17 Go, 20, 22 Go), studio-frontend (Parts 10-13), shared-space-frontend (Parts 9, 17 TS, 18, 19, 21, 22 frontend, 23).
P170 streams A, B, C run studio-go, space-go, studio-frontend; shared-space-frontend starts on the first stream to free.
P170 findings: studio-go S1–S6, space-go F1–F8 (one medium: checkout -- ambiguity), studio-frontend F1–F8 (commit-in-flight edits, double-submit, curl tokenizer, memo reset on failure), shared-space-frontend F1–F7 (one medium: blame path symlink).
All P170 findings were fixed except studio-frontend F8 (parked in P176) and studio-go S5 (P181).
P170 findings files are deleted per round.

### v2.0 P172 Space git socket trust: prepare-script approval and pairing identity
repoSettings.set refuses to write the worktree prepare script (kiraSpace.worktree.prepareScript) and returns E_READ_ONLY, so a paired socket client cannot set the script.
The settings.setGitPath socket method was removed, so a paired client cannot point git at an arbitrary executable; the contract is now version 43.
In pairing, one Approve admits only the presented pairing request, not every queued sibling with the same client id.
The socket server reads the peer uid and pid at accept and fails closed if it cannot; they are shown in the pairing dialog.
Pairing identity (clientID, label) is client-asserted in hello; binding the token to peer identity on reconnect (decision D6) remains an open item.
The documented sha256-pinned approval key prepareScriptApprovedSha does not exist in code; runPrepareScript: isWorkspaceTrusted() is only a client-side flag.
Socket trust acceptance criteria: a paired client cannot run a script or change the git path without an unforgeable host-side approval, and a same-user process cannot get a token by replaying a VS Code client id.
Console and MCP results share one row cap with a truncated flag and early cursor close (P174).
SQS read-only polls hide messages for 1 second because the AWS SDK cannot send 0 as visibility timeout; the UI shows a warning and requires confirmation.
Staged edits survive reload keyed by primary key, merged with P170's commit-in-flight refusals.
The cookie jar is forked from Go stdlib with exact delete; cookies, history and gRPC schema use TanStack Query (P175).

### v2.0 P173 Space git RPC and git-ui contract decisions
The git frame cap maxFrameBytes was raised from 8 MiB to 32 MiB, with no truncation work, because commit.detail, refs.list, status.get and working.detail answered E_FRAME_TOO_LARGE above 8 MiB.
The git pre-handshake read is capped at 64 KiB.
Auto-fetch retries transient errors with backoff, and stops on credential or remote errors with a visible marker. Before, autoFetchTick in gitsession/autofetch.go disabled auto-fetch for the entry's life on any failure except OperationInProgress, including NetworkFailed and RemoteNotFound.
Regex search mode keeps its residual gaps between JS non-u regex and RE2, notably Unicode case folding. The user decided to do nothing: no limit documentation, UI note or Go shim.
Errors in git-ui must be easily visible, through a toast or banner in both hosts, and also kept for later inspection in the ops panel. Before this, op failures and an unrecoverable graph stream reached only the sr-only live region in App.vue.
Graph and remote-op failures in git-ui show a banner with a retry hint in both hosts. The git contract version went from 43 to 44.
A user cancel (kind Cancelled) is announced but raises no banner, and reportAsyncError skips its generic banner while a stream failure is shown.
The VS Code webview is read-only, so its e2e failure source is a corrupted graph stream. The remote-op banner is covered in Kira Space only.
The git-ui component and App prop is named showOperations, not onShowOperations, because Vue treats on* props as listeners. MountOptions.onShowOperations keeps the plan's name.
The Go AutoFetchStatus lives in gitpreflight, and oplog.Log.Record returns nothing.
The VS Code webview bundle put preflight above every unprefixed Tailwind utility, because layer order follows first import, so Alert rendered unpadded. main.ts now imports tailwind.css first.
Archived ADE run logs are purged 90 days after archive (PurgeArchived, migration 0016, hourly purger), and backlog Delete asks for confirmation.
openTrackedTab has a deleted-connection guard. The grid cell editor is a textarea, and clipboard keys stay native in text controls.

### v2.0 P174 Studio result loading, browse semantics and staged edits
Console results and dbmcp run_query share one row/byte cap with a truncated page flag and early cursor close, applied to every engine and the MCP path.
Before P174, console results (runCursorOp, Redis KEYS *, SQL consoles) and dbmcp run_query materialised the whole result before any cap.
Redis console commands use bounded forms, and ZREVRANGE is also rewritten for the cap.
SQS browse uses ReceiveMessage, which hides messages from real consumers and raises the receive count even on a read-only connection, a DLQ risk with maxReceiveCount.
SQS read-only polls hide messages for 1 second, not 0, because the AWS SDK omits VisibilityTimeout: 0 from the request (indistinguishable from unset); the UI shows a warning and confirm.
SQS browse dedupes by MessageId to cover a message re-received inside one poll.
Binary Kafka and SQS payloads are shown with a binary marker instead of replacement characters; the null (tombstone) half landed earlier.
Staged grid edits survive paging, sort, filter, projection and Refresh, keyed by primary key, merged with P170's commit-in-flight refusals.
Staging an edit is refused without a full primary key, so no commit-time throw is needed.
The pending-guard registry, stale-marker, pageStale field, page-stale-strip alert and Generate Data pending lockout were removed; the mask-preview lockout stays.
TS PagePosition.truncated is optional (decoded as || undefined) so existing fixtures stay valid.
PostgreSQL keeps raw rows, capped, before bytea normalisation instead of streaming into the builder.
The console cap helpers live in adapters/consolecap.go and adapters/testsupport/consolecap.go.
P172 made repoSettings.set refuse the prepare script (E_READ_ONLY), removed settings.setGitPath (contract 43), limited one Approve to the presented pairing request, and reads peer uid and pid at accept (fail closed), shown in the pairing dialog.
Open decision D6 (bind token to peer identity on reconnect) is a known open item.
P174 decisions are to be recorded in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, with adapter conformance suites updated for the cap.

### v2.0 P175 Studio API client follow-ups
Studio API client cookies list, response history and gRPC schema runtime move from hand-rolled server-state caches to TanStack Query, keyed by URL, scope and source, with the P8 D11 lazy-when-hidden rule as enabled.
Go net/http/cookiejar cannot enumerate or delete cookies by exact id, so the cookie list can disagree with what deletes; Remove by exact domain and path needs a replacement jar, and HttpDeleteCookie plus CookiesPane.vue pass domain and path.
The cookie jar is forked from the Go stdlib cookiejar with exact delete; the ascii copy lives in cookiejar/internal/ascii, so jar.go and punycode.go differ from upstream only by the import path.
.golangci.yml excludes the vendored cookiejar files from gocognit, gocyclo, gocritic and bodyclose.
Call cancelQueries after the bridge call, not first, in deleteJarCookie and clearJarCookies, because cancelling first lets an in-flight list fetch resurrect the deleted row.
In the dotenv bulk editor, a single-quote-wrapped value loses its quotes on a no-edit Apply, and a leading single quote without a closing one makes the editor unappliable.
apiSavedRequestQueryOptions in api/state/apiQueries.ts and its gRPC twin should return null only for E_NOT_FOUND and rethrow other errors, instead of returning null on any error.
applyEditRaw in api/state/raw.ts dropped disabled header rows and descriptions on a no-edit Apply (Part 7 F17); fixed in P175.
History entries show a note in HTTP ResponsePane.vue, RawExchangePane.vue and gRPC ResponsePane.vue when requestFieldsElided or metadataElided is set.
resolveGrpcTabState lives in views/grpcrequest/resolve.ts to avoid an import cycle with schemaQuery.ts.
grpcSchemaSourceFor is synchronous and gated by a ready flag on the collections tree load.
Accepted tradeoffs: a viewing flash while a different snapshot loads, and "Method not resolved" for up to 150 ms after a schema-source edit.
P172: repoSettings.set refuses the prepare script (E_READ_ONLY); settings.setGitPath was removed (contract 43); one Approve admits only the presented pairing request; peer uid and pid are read at accept (fail closed) and shown in the pairing dialog.
Open decision D6 (bind token to peer identity on reconnect) is a known open item.
P174: console and MCP results share one cap with a truncated flag and early cursor close; SQS read-only polls hide messages for 1 second because the AWS SDK cannot send 0, with a warning and confirm.
P174: staged edits survive reload keyed by primary key, merged with P170's commit-in-flight refusals.
Stale terminalShutdown mock entries for the unbound TerminalService.Shutdown were removed, fixing the mock-runtime-bindings failure.

### v2.0 P176 Studio frontend small follow-ups
openTrackedTab and the four openers return null for a deleted connection; callers must branch on null so no tab opens on a missing target.
The connectionRecord test helper lives at apps/kira-studio/tests/unit/support/connectionRecord.ts, not tests/support/, because the studio tests tsconfig would pull the bridge in; it takes the store as an argument because a static store import loads the bridge before a spec's runtime mocks.
Go ReadRequestWire.Validate rejects a pageSize other than 10/100/1000/10000 with E_QUERY; the fkPreview.ts comment says this instead of naming the deleted readRequestWireSchema.
Mask parity fixtures under apps/kira-studio/tests/fixtures/mask/ cover U+FEFF inside a name (Go keeps one word) and an Arabic-Indic date tail; Go output matched TS with no TS change.
A queryplan fixture mysql-large-untyped-metric covers large untyped numeric keys (1234567.5, 2e20), and Go and TS agree on it.
In the grid, Ctrl/Cmd+C and V skip the grid handler inside a text control so clipboard keys stay native there.
The grid inline cell editor is a one-row textarea; the insert-row input remains an open item listed in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md Known open items.
Grid paste behaviour is kept as is, matching Excel and Google Sheets: plain multi-line text splits into rows, quoted text stays one cell; pasting into an open cell editor inserts the text as one value.
The Playwright clipboard shim lives at tests/ui/support/clipboard.ts.
The gocognit limit is 30; runRaw (mysqlfamily) and pollQueue (sqs) exceeded it and were fixed by extracting helpers.
Git frame cap is 32 MiB and the pre-handshake read is capped at 64 KiB; auto-fetch retries transient errors with backoff and stops on credential or remote errors with a visible marker.
Graph and remote-op failures show a banner with a retry hint in both hosts.
The VS Code webview CSS layer order made Alert render unpadded; fixed in P173.
Archived ADE run logs are purged 90 days after archive (PurgeArchived, migration 0016, hourly purger); backlog Delete asks for confirmation.

### v2.0 P177 Space ADE decisions
ADE run and setup logs are purged 90 days after the task is archived; the run and ade_sessions rows are kept. PurgeArchived (migration 0016) does it, run by an hourly purger in the engine loop.
Backlog Delete in AdeBacklogPage.vue asks for confirmation through a simple confirm dialog; there is no undo.
Before P177, ADE run logs (up to 2 MiB each, AdeLogTailBytes), runs and ade_sessions rows had no retention and were kept forever, even for archived tasks (ArchiveTask keeps them).
The git layer caps frames at 32 MiB and caps the pre-handshake read at 64 KiB.
Git auto-fetch retries transient errors with backoff and stops on credential or remote errors, showing a visible marker.
Graph and remote-op failures show a banner with a retry hint in both hosts.
The VS Code webview CSS layer order made Alert render unpadded; this was fixed in P173.
The grid cell editor is a textarea, and clipboard keys stay native in text controls.
openTrackedTab has a guard for deleted connections.

### v2.0 P178 VS Code extension decisions
The manifest declares capabilities.untrustedWorkspaces supported:false, so the extension starts after the user grants workspace trust; the dead workspace-trust plumbing is deleted. Before, with no such capability, VS Code disabled the extension in Restricted Mode and isWorkspaceTrusted() was never false while code ran.
Credential prompts open only in Kira Space, not in the VS Code extension; the extension's prompt UI was removed and there is no credential.cancel for the extension.
Credential prompts from socket clients and the ADE board go through gitcred.Relay and open only in Kira Space, which opens a window if none is open, as a Dock click would.
credential.provide and repoSettings.set are refused on git.sock; repoSettings.set returns E_READ_ONLY there, while the native stream still serves it.
Repository settings are edited in Space only; the extension has an editRepoSettings capability, and the VS Code settings gear is hidden.
The extension's settings migration and unread per-repo log level were removed, and the extension now uses a LogOutputChannel.
The VS Code graph follows Space's app-wide date format, delivered via app.init.dateFormat and read at each app.init, not live-pushed; a Space change shows after the next init.
gitcred.Relay is built in main.go and required by gitsock and the ADE board, with no nil fallback.
The relay prompt source label for ADE is the existing boardConnLabel ("Kira Space ade board"), and the relay Prompt has no confirm flag, matching the native dialog.
coerceSettings stays in extension.ts; it validates workbench.tree.indent and git-core tests cover it.
The git-ipc contract was bumped from 44 to 45 by P178.

### v2.0 P179 Tooling and lint cleanup
Knip followed .vue imports only by accident, because the root manifest registers the SFC compiler for all workspaces; the fix is to register knip's Vue plugin (Vue and CSS compilers) per workspace.
Fix duplicate exports reported by lint:dead; never suppress them.
The knip duplicates warn rule was removed so that new aliased duplicate exports fail lint:dead.
Duplicate exports were fixed by giving constants their own values, using one shared builder name for the read-only commit row menu, and merging byte budgets into SINGLE_ROW_MAX_BYTES (in both TS and Go).
In packages/shared, theme and workbench, knip treats every file as an entry, so unused exports there are never reported (a scratch run showed about 93, 21, 31, many false positives).
Adding vue to the four workspace manifests turns on Biome's vue domain for them; Biome reports 23 warnings and 18 infos (mostly useVueMultiWordComponentNames), none fail the hook, and they were left as is.
The empty root template in packages/theme/src/components/TooltipAnchorBridge.vue was replaced with <template><slot /></template>, which renders the same since no slot content is passed.

### v2.0 P180 Real-machine verification and pending changes (user-run) (Done)
The darwin gate on pty Close was dropped: TestSessionCloseKillsProcessGroup passes on real darwin hardware both before and with the Linux non-blocking master rewrap forced on.
On darwin, kqueue polls a pty master fine: a job detached via setsid and holding the pty slave open did not block Close (under 1 ms), because the kernel hangs up the line once the controlling shell exits, independent of fd mode.
ptmx_linux.go and ptmx_other.go were merged into ptmx_nonblocking.go, built with //go:build linux || darwin.
Measured gh pulls-list responses (open PRs, per_page=100) on four high-churn repos (vscode, kubernetes, nixpkgs, home-assistant/core) were 2.0-2.6 MiB per page and 1.4-2.2 s per request, well under the 64 MiB / 10 s apiTimeout bounds; the ~45 MiB worst-case estimate was not approached.
Recapture Ipcfixture Kafka recordings with KIRA_IPC_FIXTURES=write; never hand-edit kafka.fixture.ts.
TestFixture_Kafka produces one extra record with a nil Value (Kafka's tombstone convention), and the frontend spec asserts the tombstone row's stream-body cell shows the NULL marker with aria-label "null (tombstone)".
mockStream.ts's buildPage previously coalesced stream row bodies with ?? '', turning tombstones into empty strings; it was fixed to handle nullable bodies like timestamp.
Playwright toHaveText with a regex does not normalize whitespace the way a string match does.
pr.yml's container-tests job runs bun run test:go (go test ./...) on every PR on ubuntu-latest with real Docker.
On the Colima setup, testcontainers/ryuk never becomes ready; setting TESTCONTAINERS_RYUK_DISABLED=true works around it.
The ipcfixture package's TestMain prewarms every adapter kind regardless of -run filtering, which can contend for RAM with a running dev container stack.
Baseline snapshot capture (test:visual:update:studio) is not suitable on the Mac environment, per pr.yml's own comment.

### v2.0 P181 Studio refused-keys secrets in stored URIs
Studio stores the whole connection URI encrypted (opaque) under cipher scope connection-uri, replacing the refused-keys handling for sslpassword, tlsCertificateKeyFilePassword and proxyPassword, which previously leaked as plaintext in stored URIs on some paths.
SecretsRepo.GetURI is the only reader of the stored connection URI; the repo never selects the uri column, and connection summaries carry uri: null.
In Studio the default view shows the connection URI fully masked and no screen derives display from it (the connection name is shown); a Show button decrypts it for viewing and editing, and Save re-encrypts.
Show and Copy URI in Studio go through the gated reveal, and Reveal returns uri.
No migration of previously stored plaintext URIs was done, since nobody else uses the app; old plaintext rows fail loudly, and the stripping code and startup migration were removed.
In URI mode, Test with a typed URI no longer injects the stored password column; only fields mode does.
The Studio confirm dialog text follows the draft's mode, so an unsaved fields-to-URI flip on a fields row says "URI" while the reveal returns the password.
The queryKey helper was deleted because nothing calls it after uriHasCredentialQuery and stripQueryPassword were removed (unused lint).
The plan for P181 URI encryption is plans/P181-studio-uri-encryption.md; the decision is documented in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md.
The adapters matrix leak check includes secretsFromURI, and the test harness SeedConnection seals the URI.
ipcfixture sqs.fixture.json and tests/ipc/sqs/sqs.fixture.ts have uri hand-edited to null rather than regenerated.

### v2.0 P182 Grid header and row gutter scroll in lockstep with data (one scroller, sticky)
P182 makes the Studio data and console grid header strip and row-number gutter scroll in lockstep with the data, using one scroll container with a sticky header (position: sticky; top: 0) and sticky gutter cells (position: sticky; left: 0), so the compositor moves all three together.
Suspected cause of the header/gutter lag: SlickGrid with frozenColumn: 0 puts header and gutter in separate panes and syncs them from the scroll event in JS, one frame behind the natively scrolled viewport.
P182 scope is the Studio data and console grids in views/shared/slick/; the git graph is unaffected.
Known downsides of P182: one sticky node per rendered gutter row (~50-100) adds scroll-tree constraints; SlickGrid assumes separate header and viewport sizes so patches may break on upgrade; sticky header over absolute rows needs opaque backgrounds and z-index; wide-column scroll must keep the gutter above cells without extra layers.
P182 acceptance: no visible header/gutter lag on a real Mac (user-run), no fps drop beyond 2 in the sandbox probe (NCOLS=20 grid-scroll), and ui and visual specs green.
P182 has two independent stages (stage 1 sticky header, stage 2 sticky gutter column); both stay. Stage 2 passed its gate: data grid 50.7 fps vs baseline 51.9 (-1.2, inside the 2 fps gate).
The perf probe viewport is 29 px taller after P182 (1104x758 vs 1104x729) because the scroller now spans the header band.
support/measure.ts compared canvas-relative offsets to clientHeight, leaving uncoveredPx 29 on scroll_grid bottom rows after stage 1; fixed by subtracting the canvas offsetTop (as scrollTrace.ts does) rather than loosening the budget.
Stage 2 is restructured so git revert of the stage 1 commit applies cleanly; the ui project slick-grid data-view console then passes 48 tests.
The sticky gutter being pinned is proven only in WPE; macOS WKWebView behavior is unverified.
Known accepted residues of P182: range-selector drag autoscroll downward triggers hh px below the grid bottom, and resize/drag autoscroll-left triggers at the grid's left edge rather than the gutter's right edge. The contain and header will-change from P162 were left untouched.
The test:unit mock-runtime-bindings failure (wants TerminalService.Shutdown unmapped) is caused by stale gitignored generated frontend/bindings/, not a tracked-code defect.

### v2.0 P184 SQS read-only poll visibility timeout setting in the UI
The visibility timeout of the read-only SQS poll is a user-changeable setting in the SQS read UI, not a fixed 1 s.
The default SQS read-only poll visibility timeout stays 1 s: it keeps messages visible to real consumers, but a message can be received more than once per poll; P183 stops the poll at the first duplicate batch.
The UI states the trade-off: a longer visibility timeout avoids repeat receives but hides messages from consumers for that long.
The poll visibility timeout is validated against SQS's 0 to 12 h range, with a floor of 1 s because the SDK cannot send 0.
The SQS poll confirm dialog names the chosen visibility timeout and the redrive limit.
The read-only SQS command text shows VisibilityTimeout=N, and the Go adapter's Read parses the stream filter first (parseStreamFilter), with receiveInput taking the hide seconds.
The tab state schema for the poll visibility timeout uses .catch alone, without .default(), which covers both a missing key and a corrupt value.
Use text-error, not the retired text-destructive alias, because the lint hook rejects text-destructive.
The poll's disabled-state tooltip reuses the range hint text.
The UI spec for poll visibility (sqs-poll-visibility) uses the shared fixture tests/ui/support/sqsFixture.ts.

### v2.0 P168
The P168 whole-codebase review covered 22 chunks (Parts 2-23) in three streams: A (Studio Go and shared bases), B (Space), C (Studio frontend and Space ADE frontend); Part 1 is the pre-plan.
P168 review process per chunk: one Opus reviewer, findings file committed before the Sonnet fixer, fixes committed per related group, then the findings file deleted; per-part plans stay as the record.
P168 produced 376 findings: 10 high, 101 medium, 264 low, and 1 unrated design decision (Part 20 F12). Every finding not parked was fixed in its part.
Part 6 F9: a projection with an unaliased or quoted-alias masked column slipped past the mask in dbmcp; fixed so any non-bare projection of a masked column is refused (4037466).
Part 6 F6: plan metrics on a masked connection leaked through dbmcp; fixed by switching to an allowlist (1f6e069).
Part 18 F13: OpsState got no RepoSettingsState in App.vue, so the checkout.autoStash opt-out was ignored and checkout always auto-stashed; fixed with a regression test through createRepoStates (ebe3c02).
Part 11 F6: Commit could run twice and edits staged during a commit were dropped; fixed in 11ef40e.
Part 13 F12: the Filters dialog started empty and saving wiped the saved tree filters; fixed to seed from the saved set and report save errors (5c9c132).
Part 21 F1: Space panel resize handles snapped to their limit on every drag and a click persisted a width of 0; fixed to use the pointer delta (05b13be).
Part 3 F1-F3: read-only console escapes (Postgres wrap, MySQL/MariaDB comment syntax) and ClassifySQL reporting executing writes as read were fixed in 140b4a7.
Part 14 F5: the catfile circuit breaker was tripped by context cancels; fixed in 7b44882.
The grid perf change 71d7c6a (header will-change, cell borders) was reverted and then adjusted three more times; final state is b6843c1 (b088feb, 0eeedb6, 4d65b17).
P169 (gh response cap) came from Part 14 F16, and the Kafka tombstone UI test (Part 12 F17) now lives in P180.
Parked P168 findings each have one SPEC.md row: P172 (Part 17 F5, F7 security), P173, P174, P175, P176, P177, P178, P179 (tooling and lint), P180 (capable-machine verification). P170 reviews the fixes.
<!-- /chapter v2.0 -->

<!-- chapter v2.1 -->
## v2.1
Source: docs/v2.1/ at bd0c224688d9. 26 phases.
v2.0 topped out at P184; the v2.1 chapter continues the P sequence from P185 with twelve user requests against both apps, including workflow edits saved explicitly and applied only to work not yet started.
P203-P207 (stream F) is a rework round on user feedback about shipped v2.1 work, covered by plans/P203-P207-plan.md, with one sequential implementer in v2.1-stream-F and rows in the user's priority order.
P203-P204 may run beside stream E; P205-P207 start only after stream E lands, because they share the ade wire and files.
The previously queued audit and review were renumbered P208 and P209 (plans/queued-requests.md).

### v2.1 P185 Panel resize stays attached to the cursor — root-cause and fix in the shared handle
In reka-ui 2.10.5, a SplitterResizeHandle is re-registered when its hitAreaMargins prop changes identity.
WorkbenchShell passed a literal hitAreaMargins, so a mid-drag render dropped the handle's registry data and mouseup reached no active handle; data-state went inactive before release and panels kept pointer-events: none.
The panel-resize drag-stuck bug was fixed in the shared ResizableHandle.vue (packages/theme) by giving it stable hitAreaMargins.
useDragReleaseFallback.ts replays release on window (reka and pointerup modes) and is also used by DockResizeHandle and AdePanelResizeHandle.
No lostpointercapture listener was added to the drag release fallback, because VueUse-based handles already end the drag on pointercancel.
KuiColumnResizeHandle was left unchanged by the drag-release fix.
Each app has a panel-resize.spec.ts UI test guarding the drag-release fix; it failed before the fix and passes after.
Acceptance for the panel resize fix: release ends every drag, no handle keeps data-state="drag", and no panel keeps pointer-events: none.

### v2.1 P186 Terminal module: one quick-command entry point, multiline command
TerminalPanel.vue has a single quick-command entry point: one header '+' button, plus the empty-state button, opens QuickCommandsDialog.vue; the inline add row and the gear button were removed.
Command fields in QuickCommandsDialog use the shadcn-vue Textarea (packages/theme/src/components/ui/textarea), so commands can be multiline.
A multiline quick command runs as-is via shell -c (internal/terminal/session.go); the panel row shows only its first line followed by an ellipsis.
In the quick-commands dialog, Cmd/Ctrl+Enter adds a command.
The quick-commands header button's test id is quick-commands-add (renamed from quick-commands-manage in P204, which supersedes P186 in form).

### v2.1 P187 Terminal module: quick-command collections, left-aligned titles
Terminal module quick commands have a collection field: a free-text group name where an empty string means ungrouped.
The quick-command collection is added by Kira Studio migration 0031 on custom_scripts, plus model.CustomScriptFields and packages/shared/domain/scripts.ts.
The quick-command dialog's collection field lets the user pick an existing collection or type a new one, implemented with a datalist.
The quick-commands panel groups rows under collapsible collection headers; collapsed collection names are stored with useLocalStorage.
Quick-command row titles are left-aligned; previously the row button centred the text.
There is no rename or delete UI for collections; to change a collection, edit the collection field on each command.

### v2.1 P188 "Keep this Mac awake while a Claude Code session is running" moves to Kira Space only
The setting "Keep this Mac awake while a Claude Code session is running" exists only in Kira Space; Kira Studio no longer has it.
Kira Studio removed the Claude Code keep-awake setting: ClaudeCodePane.vue, the claudeCode settings section (TS and Go), KeepAwakeService.SetAgentAware/agent reason, the registry OnChange hook and mock channels; migration 0032 drops the stored row.
The title-bar manual keep-awake toggle stays in both Kira Studio and Kira Space.
Kira Space has the setting claudeCode.keepAwakeWithAgents in the Claude Code pane of Settings, applied by its own KeepAwakeService from live Claude Code sessions: terminal-registry agent sessions plus running ade headless sessions.
Kira Space applies keep-awake through the package-level function bridge.KeepAwakeRecompute, not a method, because Wails binds every exported method.

### v2.1 P189 Git module: cached GitHub PRs; PR badge only at the branch tip in the graph
In apps/kira-space/internal/gitsession/gh.go, GitHub PR entries are kept and stale ones revalidated (stale-while-revalidate, refreshed once per key in the background via markStale()) instead of being dropped with drop() on every refsChanged.
packages/git-ui/src/state/pr.ts keeps last-known PR facts per repo while a refetch runs, so PR facts survive a refs change and a repo/tab switch.
The graph (CommitGrid.vue) badges a PR only on the commit the PR's head points at (prsHeadedAt).
Commit details (DetailPane.vue/CommitMeta.vue) keep the ancestry-derived PR rather than the branch-tip-only badge.
No server push for PR changes exists, so a stale PR answer is corrected only on the next request.

### v2.1 P190 One repository list and one import dialog, opened from the Git module
Kira Space had two repo-import paths, both writing code_repos: the Git module (state/coderepos.ts importRepoViaDialog, repo/GitStart.vue) and ade (ade/AdeView.vue empty state, ade/v2/repos/AdeReposPage.vue add-folder/add-repo inputs).
Before P190, the frontend repo list synced only while ade's own subscription (ade/queries.ts) was installed.
Every Go repo mutation already fires the kira:adetask:repos event; the sync defect came from list sync living in ade code plus duplicate dialogs.
A single ReposDialog.vue in the Git module handles importing a repository, adding/watching/removing a scan folder, and listing and removing repos; it is opened only from the Git panel and GitStart.vue.
ade drops its import UI and consumes the shared repo list.
The repo-list subscription lives at app boot (initCodeRepos) so every module sees every change in every window.
P190 is first in Stream C (user request 7); P194 restyles the markup P190 leaves.

### v2.1 P191 Agents module: git refresh does nothing — diagnose and fix
TaskBoard.Refresh in internal/ade/board.go fetches correctly for both Refresh(nil) and Refresh([ids]); the suspected repo-set mismatch does not cause the git refresh problem.
The UI (AdePlanView.vue runRefresh and AdeReviewSync.vue) sends explicit repo ids to adeTask.Refresh.
Env scripts, which can take up to 60 s, run beside the git fetch in the refresh.
AdeReviewSync shows a per-repo error row when a refresh fails for a repo.
The refresh fix is covered by board_refresh_test.go and ade-v2-plan.spec.ts.

### v2.1 P192 Agents module: move a work item's stage forward or backward
Before SetTaskStage, only StageDone moved a work item's stage forward, and only once the stage's steps were done.
SetTaskStage(taskId, stageId) moves a task to any stage of its workflow, or to done, and is refused while a run of that task is live.
The Agents module task panel offers Back/Next buttons plus a stage picker (shadcn-vue DropdownMenu) in AdeStageMover.vue, using the useSetTaskStage hook.
SetTaskStage is implemented across the Go service, the wire layer, and the useSetTaskStage frontend hook.
The Go test for SetTaskStage covers both directions, done, an unknown stage, and the live-run guard.

### v2.1 P193 Agents module: session tabs named after the workflow stage; Claude session id visible and copyable
In the Agents module, session tabs are named from the session's own stageId: stage · step · repo or stage · repo|spec; review and spec sessions keep their own names.
The session pane header shows the full Claude session id with a copy button, implemented in AdeSessionId.vue using VueUse useClipboard.

### v2.1 P194 Agents module looks and behaves like the rest of the app
The ade (Agents module) panels, tabs, gaps between panels and inputs must use the same components and spacing as the Kira Space/Studio workbench: bordered rounded panels on the chrome background with the shell's gap.
The ade module uses tabChipVariants for tabs, the shared panel-header bar, and default shadcn-vue Input/Button/Switch sizing, with no per-page hard-coded pixel sizes.
The ade Plan view keeps its timeline but sits in the same panel frame as other panels.
P194 moved the ade shell, panel tabs, session strip and form controls onto shared tokens, tabChipVariants and a new PanelHeader.vue; check-ade-colours.sh passes.

### v2.1 P195 SQL grid keeps column widths across data reloads
In Kira Studio's data grid, buildColumns (views/grid/SlickGridHost.vue) used to fall back to initialWidths(page), measured afresh from every new page, so each reload re-sized every column the user never dragged.
DataViewRuntime (views/grid/state.ts) keeps the tab's settled column widths in settledWidths, keyed by the column-name set, in the same shape as the console's consoleColumnWidths.
buildColumns reuses the settled widths while the column set is unchanged and re-measures only when the column set changes.
An empty page does not settle column widths in the SQL grid.
The slick-grid.spec.ts case covers width persistence across reloads (119 with the fix vs 480 without).
The required settledWidths field on DataViewRuntime needed a one-line edit in grid-pending-by-primary-key.spec.ts.

### v2.1 P196 Agents module: workflow edits saved explicitly, applied only to work not yet started
Before P196, the workflow editor autosaved: AdeWorkflowForm.vue with a 500 ms debounce, AdeWorkflowYaml.vue with an 800 ms debounce.
Before P196, a started task bound to its workflow live by workflowId and only the current stage was snapshotted (ade_tasks.current_stage_json), so StageDone in internal/ade/runs.go read the next stage from the edited file.
Both workflow editors use an explicit Save and Discard with no autosave; they have a Save/Discard bar and Cmd/Ctrl+S.
A started task snapshots the whole workflow it began with, stored in new ade_tasks columns workflow_json and workflow_hash (migration 0017, Kira Space), and every stage move reads that snapshot.
A not-started task keeps following the live workflow file, so edits apply only to work not yet started.
The task's workflow selector (AdeWorkflowBlock.vue) shows the current version plus an "updated, applies to new work only" indicator (workflowOutdated badge) when the task's snapshot differs.
P196 changes StageDone and P192's SetTaskStage to read the snapshot; it is the last item in Stream C.
The snapshot is taken by taskWorkflow/snapshotWorkflow at first run, session or stage move.
SetTaskWorkflow stays allowed for a started task; it resets the task and now clears the snapshot, because refusing would remove the only restart path.
Recover backfills workflow snapshots for started tasks.
Known open issue: unsaved workflow editor edits are lost on module switch.

### v2.1 P197 Agents module: skip a workflow stage
A workflow stage can be skipped via a stage flag in the workflow file (skip: true), implemented in the adeflow parser and writer and as adewire.Stage.Skip.
No task enters a skipped stage when created, on StageDone or by SetTaskStage; a skipped stage the task already sits on stays its current stage.
A workflow must keep at least one stage runnable (not skipped).
The skip toggle in the workflow editor goes through P196's explicit Save, so a started task keeps its snapshot of the workflow.
Right-clicking a stage in the workflow editor (AdeStageCard.vue) opens the shared context menu with Skip / Don't skip, move up, move down and remove.
The task view offers a one-off skip: right-clicking a stage block gives Move task here / Skip this stage, using P192's SetTaskStage.
The stage mover, progress segments and Done action step over skipped stages.
The stage-card right-click menu uses the workbench ContextMenu.vue, not a new shadcn ContextMenu.
Refusal to enter a skipped stage lives in Go (ade/stages.go traversal, tested in stages_test.go), so the mock runtime was not changed.

### v2.1 P198 Agents module: task context menu
The Agents module task context menu opens by right-clicking a task card, pressing Shift+F10, or using the panel header's More actions button.
The task context menu is built only on existing calls.
Task context menu items: current stage action, Move to stage, Skip stage, Stop running agents, Open session, Show sessions, Plan (today, next work day, Later), Mark as (not) merging, Open Jira / GitHub, Copy (title, id, Jira link, branch names, Claude session id), Archive.
A review task gets only a read-only subset of the task context menu.
P198 (task context menu) belongs to Stream E and comes after P197; its Skip item uses P197's traversal.
The task menu uses descriptors in board/taskMenu.ts and useTaskMenu.ts, and is covered by the spec ade-v2-task-menu.spec.ts.
The context menu handler sits on the whole card box, because review cards have no head.

### v2.1 P199 Kira Space tools for agents (MCP), enabled per workflow
The workflow flag kira_space_mcp: true enables Kira Space tools for agents via MCP, per workflow.
The adeagent loopback MCP server has scoped grants (run, task, Space) with one bearer token per launch.
Headless runs and the task's TUI sessions (stage, branch, take over) get the grant only when their workflow snapshot has the kira_space_mcp flag.
The agent tools act only on the token's task: task_info, declare_repos, request_branch, branch_status.
declare_repos accepts registered repos only and is additive.
request_branch takes an agent-chosen name validated with git check-ref-format, is idempotent, refuses collisions, and creates the worktree plus prepare script through the existing ensureWorktree/startSetup.
branch_status waits for the branch setup to finish.
Branches and repos that the agent added or named carry origin = 'agent' (migration 0018) and show a badge.
Open issue: unnamed branches are created before the agent can request one.

### v2.1 P200 Docker module: containers, images, volumes, networks; logs, exec, CPU/RAM
The Docker module (P200) is a new shared module registered only in Kira Studio; Space adopts it later.
The Docker module backend is Go package internal/docker, using the Engine API via github.com/moby/moby/client and ssh:// via docker/cli connhelper, exposed through a BoundService with a Studio shim at bridge/docker.go.
The Docker module frontend is the package packages/docker-ui, named @kira/docker-ui.
The Docker module lets users browse containers (grouped by Compose project), images, volumes and networks, and start/stop/restart containers, with live logs (follow, filter, timestamps) and per-container CPU and RAM in the list and a Stats view.
Exec into a Docker container goes through the shared terminal stack (TerminalHostView).
The Docker endpoint is resolved in docker CLI order: DOCKER_HOST, contexts including TLS, then a socket probe for Desktop/Colima/OrbStack; not-installed, daemon-down and unreachable states are handled explicitly.
Docker module streams run only while the module is visible and end on close, window close and quit.
The Docker module plan is in plans/P200-plan.md, including its seam list of edits to Stream A files.
The Docker module implementation uses the Moby client v0.5.1 typed Options/Result API.
In the Docker UI, InspectView is a pre element with class font-data, and container rows are role=option in a listbox.
Docker logs with Wrap on render only the last 2000 lines, unvirtualized.
The Docker sparkline component is named StatsSparkline.vue.
Known open issue: remote tcp:// Docker endpoints without TLS are allowed.
Known open issue: exec chips persist after the container stops.
The Docker module adds a fourth mode tab, which changes the visual baselines.

### v2.1 P201 Part 1 Memory MCP server and Memory module
Claude Code stores memories through a kira-memory stdio MCP server started with the Kira Studio executable's memory-mcp subcommand.
The kira-memory MCP server exposes tools store_memory (items of fact + reason, author user or agent), search_memories (with an includeHistory flag) and memory_history, plus the prompt remember (slash command).
Every memory store goes through an isolated claude -p Sonnet gate with no CLAUDE.md, settings, MCP or tools, seeing only the request and related memories.
The gate splits input into atomic facts and challenges ambiguity, missing or weak reasons, and secrets; it returns questions and stores nothing until they are answered.
Accepted facts are reconciled against FTS candidates with an outcome of add, update or noop; an update keeps the old row as a historical version.
The memory store is its own SQLite database at ~/.kira-memory/memory.db with an FTS5 index.
Memory search favours recall: OR-prefix terms, stemming, write-time keywords, and ordering by bm25 only.
Kira Studio gains a Memory module, built on shared code in packages/workbench/src/memory/, with a search bar, version trail and an Add memory dialog over the same store pipeline.
P201 was built as Stream D in its own worktree beside B (P200) and C; its plan is plans/P201-plan.md.
P201 built internal/memory (store, FTS5 search, gate, reconcile, service), memorycli, mcpserver, bridge.MemoryService, shared packages/workbench/src/memory/ and the memory-mcp subcommand.
P201 deviations from plan: Service.Close is the package-level bridge.CloseMemory; StoreRequest.Progress forwards MCP progress; toolexec.RunIO returns stdout alongside *ExecError; ErrClaudeOutdated was added; commitFact returns the post-commit revision.
Hosting the Memory module in Studio was undone by Part 2.

### v2.1 P201 Part 2 Move the Memory module to Kira Space
The Memory module lives in Kira Space, not Kira Studio, by user decision; Studio returns to its v2.0 mode set (Docker stays).
Kira Space hosts bridge.MemoryService, the memory-mcp stdio subcommand, a memory mode, provide and bridge control, UI mocks and memory-module.spec.ts.
The memory-mcp subcommand runs before the single-instance lock in Space, and the kira-memory MCP server runs as "<Kira Space executable>" memory-mcp.
The memory mode is last in MODE_ORDER and persisted in windows.mode, with no migration.
mcpinstall was hoisted to repo-root internal/mcpinstall so Space can register the MCP server.
Shared memory parts stay in place: internal/memory, packages/workbench/src/memory/, @shared/domain/memory, and the database ~/.kira-memory/memory.db.
gocognit rejected main, so both argv shims (including memory-mcp) run from runArgvShim instead of main.
The memory-mcp server works (store_memory and search_memories) even while another app instance holds app.lock.
Memory mode currently shows an empty tab strip, an open issue.

### v2.1 P202 Agents and Git: prepare-script progress and failure wherever one runs
Every trigger of a worktree prepare script shows a running indicator and, on failure, the reason: ADE StartRun, LaunchStage/StartBranch/TakeOver/review agent (via launchGate), AddExistingBranch, RetrySetup, P199's request_branch, and the git module's worktree dialog and toolbar strip (where the host allows running it).
The failure reason of a worktree prepare script is stored with the setup in ade_worktree_setup.note (migration 0019).
A launch blocked by a running setup waits and starts when ready instead of failing (E_PREPARING wait-then-start).
ADE and git-ui share one ScriptProgress component, located in packages/theme.
A git-ui prepare-script failure stays visible after its dialog closes.
The git-ui toolbar strip shows spinner, folder and last output line; elapsed time appears in the Output popover.
In the git-ui dialog, Close after a finished prepare run dismisses the result.
The Space Git window still refuses worktree.prepare, by user decision.

### v2.1 P203 Git graph: rows vanish after a refs change; a commit click leaves the graph blank
Bug (P203): a graph re-walk from row 0 (refsChanged auto refresh or toolbar Refresh) cleared the store and appended a shorter first page while GraphViewState.plan still mapped the old row count.
The stale plan made the CommitGrid.vue generation watcher re-render so rowHasBadges called store.shaAt, which threw 'ShaTable: row N out of range', leaving SlickGrid half-updated (blank top rows, newest commits missing).
The graph blank/row-vanish bug was pre-existing at ba8419e and made frequent by P191 (fetch every board repo) and P189 (PR revalidation on every refs change).
Fix: onReset in graphView.ts clears the pending layout range and drops layout and plan together with the store, so plan.length <= store.rowCount at reset.
Regression coverage for P203: a unit test checks plan.length <= store.rowCount at reset, and repo-graph-rewalk.spec.ts (Space UI re-walk spec, mock with per-open chunk lists) fails on the base tree with 'ShaTable: row 3 out of range'.
Known open issue after P203: after a refresh the graph viewport keeps its pre-refresh scroll offset.
P203-P207 (stream F) is a rework round on user feedback for shipped v2.1 work, run as one plan (plans/P203-P207-plan.md) by one sequential implementer in v2.1-stream-F, with rows in the user's priority order.
P203-P204 may run beside stream E, but P205-P207 start only after E lands because they share the ade wire and files.
The previously queued audit and review were renumbered P208/P209 (plans/queued-requests.md).

### v2.1 P204 Terminal module: one way to add a quick command, a real multiline script field, in both apps
Kira Space had no quick commands before P204: no `scripts` seam, store or table.
In the terminal module, the header `+` is the only control for adding a quick command.
The quick-command dialog edits one command at a time (add, or Edit… from the row menu), with a `Textarea` script field about 8 rows tall, monospace, resizable, where Cmd/Ctrl+Enter saves.
Quick commands are shared between Studio and Kira Space through the Go package `internal/quickcommands` (Studio's own model and repo were deleted) and Space migration `0020`.
A shared store factory, `createCustomScriptsStore`, lives in `packages/workbench/src/terminal` and serves both apps' quick commands.
`ValidationError` messages from the quickcommands package now read `quickcommands: …`.
The tab-strip `+` menu does not list scripts, so P204 changed nothing there.
P203-P207 (stream F) is a rework round for user feedback on shipped v2.1 work, planned in `plans/P203-P207-plan.md`, done by one sequential implementer in `v2.1-stream-F`, with rows in the user's priority order.
P203-P204 may run beside stream E, but P205-P207 start only after E lands, because they share the `ade` wire and files.
The previously queued audit and review were renumbered P208/P209 (tracked in `plans/queued-requests.md`).

### v2.1 P205 Repositories: all repository configuration in the one Git-module dialog
P205 moves all per-repository configuration (nickname, prepare-worktree script and timeout, integration branches, environments, worktree base path) into ReposDialog.vue, with a repo list, config form and Scan folders tab.
Before P205, ReposDialog.vue (from P190) held only import and scan folders, per-repo configuration sat on the Agents Repos tab, and the worktree base path had no editor.
The repositories dialog opens from four places: the Git panel header, GitStart, a repo-row "Configure repository…" item, and the Agents empty state.
The Agents Repos tab and its page were removed in P205.
The new worktreeBasePath field is carried through UpdateRepo; no Go test covers it because validation is a single condition.
P205 belongs to stream F and runs after P204 and after stream E lands, because it shares the adewire Repo/RepoPatch types and the ADE shell with stream E.
P203-P207 (stream F) are a rework round from user feedback on shipped v2.1 work, planned in plans/P203-P207-plan.md, done by one sequential implementer in v2.1-stream-F, with rows in the user's priority order.
P203-P204 may run beside stream E, while P205-P207 start only after E lands because they share the ade wire and files.
The previously queued audit and review were renumbered P208/P209 (plans/queued-requests.md).

### v2.1 P206 Kira Space: Terminal module after Agents

### v2.1 P207 Agents module: one visual system with the workbench
In the Agents module (ADE), full-layout modules render on chrome with one frame per pane, via the mainFramed prop on WorkbenchShell.
Every pane in the Agents module uses PanelHeader instead of hand-made headers.
Agents module controls use shadcn controls at default sizes (kira, kira-lg, kira-icon) instead of mixed button sizes per row.
Agents module styling uses tokens only for sizes (timeline geometry is allowlisted), avoiding arbitrary pixel classes.
font-data is used for code-like text only in the Agents module, not for prose.
After P207, two arbitrary pixel classes remain under ade/, both border-[1.5px] ring weight, and three raw button elements remain (task card title, attention badge, session tab chips).
P207 (Agents module visual alignment, stream F) must land after stream E, because E edits the same ADE files.
P203-P207 (stream F rework round) follow one plan, plans/P203-P207-plan.md, run by one sequential implementer in v2.1-stream-F, with rows in the user's priority order.
P203-P204 may run beside stream E, but P205-P207 start only after E lands, because of the shared ade wire and files.
The previously queued audit and review were renumbered P208 and P209 in plans/queued-requests.md.

### v2.1 P208 Requirements audit
Phase P208 is a requirements audit that checks every user request in the v2.1 chapter against shipped code and tests in one pass.
The P208 audit covers the 12 original requests (P185-P196), P197-P199, P200, P201, P202, and P203-P207.
P208 audit findings are filed under plans/, and every gap goes back to a Sonnet fixer under the same phase number.
P208 runs only after every other v2.1 phase lands.
P203-P207 (stream F) is a rework round on user feedback about shipped v2.1 work, planned in plans/P203-P207-plan.md and run by one sequential implementer in v2.1-stream-F, with rows in the user's priority order.
P203-P204 may run beside stream E, but P205-P207 start only after E lands, because they share the ade wire and files.
The previously queued audit and review were renumbered P208 and P209; details are in plans/queued-requests.md.

### v2.1 P209 Code review
Code review per CLAUDE.md "Code review" uses one Opus subagent, three dimensions, with scope = everything since the last review session (base commit stated); the findings file is committed before any fixer starts.
Memory: a stale revision re-decides every uncommitted fact.
PR cache: a refs change re-asks only branches with a PR; a server-side "no PR" entry stays fresh across refs changes.
Docker: exec open is bounded and cancelled on window close; unverified TLS is marked insecure; logs close awaits an in-flight open; exec chips use shared buttons.
ADE: branch_status returns the setup failure note and polls one row; a refused stage move no longer snapshots the workflow; abandoned launch grants release on a timer.
Space: keep-awake counts headless sessions in SQL.
P203-P207 (stream F) is a rework round on user feedback on shipped v2.1 work, planned in plans/P203-P207-plan.md, run by one sequential implementer in v2.1-stream-F with rows in the user's priority order.
P203-P204 may run beside stream E; P205-P207 start only after E lands, because they share the ade wire and files.
The previously queued audit and review were renumbered P208 and P209 in plans/queued-requests.md.
<!-- /chapter v2.1 -->

<!-- chapter v2.2 -->
## v2.2
Source: docs/v2.2/ at bd0c224688d9. 67 phases.
The v2.2 chapter continues from P210 because v2.1 topped out at P209.
Work in v2.2 happens on branch v2.0 with a maximum of 2 concurrent streams.
P210 and P211 run sequentially in Stream A because both touch memory in the same subsystem; P212 is Stream B; P213 is Stream C, a user override of the 2-stream cap.
P262 requires a unified style across both apps and all modules, covering dialogs (alignment, spacing, buttons, inputs) and secondary tabs, which are inconsistent, while the main tab bar already seems unified.
P262 process: go over all UI, use the same elements everywhere, align sizes, proportions and spacing; decide the unified design first, then apply it in chunks, with implementation and chunked analysis on 2 streams.
For P262, every look decision must be made in the plan, with none left for sign-off.
Left panels have different functionality, but much of their visuals can be unified (P262 amendment).
P263 unifies the remaining element families the same way as P262: tables/lists/tree rows, badges/chips/pills, checkboxes/switches/radios, tooltips, toasts, loading states, alerts/validation, context menus/dropdowns, scrollbars/split handles, cards/panels, kbd hints, colour/status tokens, focus rings/disabled states, mobile.
P263 must be planned with decisions, a foundation and streams, and starts only after P262 is fully implemented.
P263 uses 3 parallel streams (A, B, C), not 2.
P263 requires AdePanelResizeHandle to match the shell handle in thickness, hit target, gap, idle/hover/drag colours, cursor, focus and keyboard behaviour.
The ADE resize handle keeps its VueUse mechanics per P132, with the shared visual provided via one class/variant.
The P263 handle unification supersedes the P262 close-out's 4px ADE handle.

### v2.2 P210 Memory embedding search: local embedding model (best quality under 500 MB RAM, less if possible), vectors in SQLite,... (Done)
Memory search is hybrid keyword (FTS, recall-first) plus semantic, using a local embedding model with vectors stored in SQLite file memory.db.
The embedding model is English-only arctic-embed-s int8 (decision D1). Alternative if multilingual is needed: multilingual-e5-small int8 (362 MB peak, weaker English retrieval).
The embedding model (35 MB, pinned SHA-256) is downloaded on user click rather than bundled with the app (decision D2).
Semantic candidates are enabled in reconcile, with a cosine floor of 0.85 (decision D3).
The runtime is yalue/onnxruntime_go with hftokenizer running arctic-embed-s int8: 95 MB loaded, 137 MB peak RAM, 4 ms for short and 35 ms for long text (Linux x86_64, 4 cores, 2 intra-op threads). Chosen.
The hugot pure-Go backend with bge-small was rejected: 458 MB loaded, 1.05 GB peak, 40x slower than ORT.
The hugot ORT backend was rejected because it drags GoMLX and go-xla into go.mod.
llama.cpp and sqlite-vec were rejected: they need a second native toolchain, and sqlite-vec is a native SQLite extension that modernc.org/sqlite cannot load.
EmbeddingGemma (Gemma terms) and jina v3 (CC-BY-NC) were rejected because their licences are not open-source.
A search_memories call made while indexing returns keyword-only results; once ready, a query with no shared words returns the semantic match first with [semantic] and state ready. The embedding worker exits 300 s after the last search.
The embedding worker used 146 MB RSS after backfill plus query.
The smoke test showed embedding dim 384, unit-norm vectors, and top-1 9/10 on the 10-query paraphrase probe.
The ORT tgz hashes for osx-arm64 and linux-x64 are verified by scripts/fetch-onnxruntime.sh.
embed.ClientOptions.Command takes only modelDir.
Memory.seq is an unexported field set by memoryColumns (which now ends in m.seq), and searchFTS returns []Memory.
Installed and the manifest live in embed/manifest.go because the client needs them before the installer; normalize lives in vector.go so fake-worker tests run with CGO_ENABLED=0.
The added progress shadcn-vue component uses bg-field instead of the registry's bg-muted, because check-theme-classes.sh guards against the retired bg-muted alias.
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build of ./apps/kira-space/... cannot pass on Linux because Wails needs cgo; the non-cgo stub path is checked on ./internal/memory/... instead.
macOS support is unverified: dylib load from Contents/Frameworks, arm64 int8 kernels, worker footprint, and codesign verify. Tokenizer parity is checked only by the 9/10 ranking probe.

### v2.2 P211 Memory bulk import: pick file or folder; chunk to a Sonnet-friendly size; per-chunk clean-context agent extracts atom... (Done)
Memory bulk import lets the user pick files or a folder, scans them, confirms an estimate, extracts facts per chunk, and adds memories per file through the MCP.
Bulk import chunks files to a Sonnet-friendly size; a per-chunk clean-context agent extracts atomic facts, and one final agent holding all chunk facts of the file adds memories through the MCP.
Memory bulk import uses goldmark for chunk boundaries, the go-git gitignore matcher, and backoff/v4, with no tokenizer.
The bulk import estimate constants are 20 facts per chunk, 18 s per extract, and finalize 15 s plus 25 s per 20 facts.
Imported fact reasons have the format: Stated in <path>, <heading>: "<evidence>".
Gate and reconcile calls inside memory-mcp are not included in the measured import costs.
Gitignore handling in bulk import uses gitignore.ParsePattern per directory rather than ReadPatterns over an osfs filesystem: same matcher, no billy wiring, patterns scoped to their directory.
--allowedTools is passed as one comma-joined argument so the variadic flag cannot swallow the next flag.
The memory-mcp re-exec for the smoke test sits in the importer package's single TestMain.
In the import file list, the selected file's reason, unresolved and dropped facts are shown in a fixed panel under the virtualized list so rows keep one height.
Quit-mid-run recovery of bulk import is covered by engine tests only.

### v2.2 P212 Part 1 Mobile agents web: local web server in Kira Space serving a read-only mobile-laid-out Vue agents module; first-load d... (Done)
Kira Space serves a read-only mobile-laid-out Vue agents web app from a local web server (P212), with first-load device approval in Kira Space like the git extension pairing.
The mobile agents web app has three tabs: Backlog, Need You, Plan; the user narrowed the scope to these.
The mobileweb server allowlist is GET only plus POST /api/pair; there is no terminal/PTY attach.
Mobile web auth (per-device cookie token, csrfGuard, route table) is built so that adding a write endpoint takes one route-table row.
P212 added generic internal/pairing and internal/embedded packages, appevent.Tap, a mobileweb server, migration 0021, a desktop Mobile access pane and pairing dialog, a transport-agnostic ADE reader, a second Vite build, and Playwright mobile projects.
The installable PWA and the local CA of the mobile web were removed in P223.
Design facts for the mobile agents web are documented in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md under "Mobile agents web (P212, Kira Space)".
Mobile UI tests run via bun run test:ui:space-mobile, using iOS WebKit and Pixel Chromium emulation.
Adding a "Mobile access" row to the Settings nav changed the four Settings dialog snapshots in test:visual:space.
Planned follow-up P212 Part 2: backlog add and reorder, TUI input for stuck agents, start/next/prev workflow stage, and phone attach of the Claude Code terminal (desktop shows disconnected plus a reconnect button).

### v2.2 P212 Part 2 Mobile agents web writes (amendment): backlog add and reorder, TUI input for stuck agents, start/next/prev workflow s... (Done)
P212 (mobile agents web writes) added backlog add and reorder, TUI input for stuck agents, start/next/prev workflow stage, and phone attach of the Claude Code terminal; the desktop shows disconnected plus a reconnect button.
P212 design facts live in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md under "Mobile agents web (P212, Kira Space)"; try-it steps are in docs/DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md.
P212 built migration 0022 with permission settings, a stale-stage guard, shared stageMoves/withMovedItem/useLaunchOpener, guarded write routes with idempotency, MobileWriter and a launch rendezvous.
P212 added internal/terminal.Arbiter and internal/mobileterm (ring, broker, WebSocket), plus a desktop overlay with Reconnect and a phone writes UI and terminal screen.
A reloaded phone deep link always redirected to Need You because the first auth check fired the phase watcher; fixed in mobile/App.vue.
Take over has no Playwright spec because there is no stuck-run fixture; Go tests cover its route and rendezvous.
P212 changes the Settings dialog visual snapshots for test:visual:space (two switches per row and the global switch).

### v2.2 P213 Tailwind audit (user-requested, runs now on stream C as an exception to row order): replace hand-written CSS with Tai... (Done)
P213 Tailwind audit replaced hand-written CSS with Tailwind utilities across both apps and shared packages, including partial matches, and skipped files owned by P210–P212.
Connection and type colours use literal class maps (connBgClass, connTextClass, columnTypeTextClass) instead of direct :style colour paints.
Static :style keys moved to classes; :style bindings keep only runtime geometry, reducing bindings from 250 to 142.
ADE tone tokens are @theme tokens in ade/v2/tones.css; tones.ts keeps class maps only; tagStyle, solidStyle and actionStyle were deleted.
The git-ui commit grid cell, badge and ref-strip CSS use kv: utilities, and CommitGrid.vue SlickGrid overrides use @apply, reducing the style block from 47 to 16 rule blocks.
Studio slickTheme.css was reduced from 70 to 63 rule blocks and 825 to 715 lines, moving only the safe single-declaration subset to @apply.
The Space review load-error zone uses utilities, its retry button uses buttonVariants, and its rules were deleted from review-decorations.css.
base.css html/body and MonacoHost.vue find-match tints use @apply.
CSS deliberately kept in slickTheme.css (63 rules) covers vendor DOM, composites, raw px sizes, .cell-input states and scrollbar pseudo rules; the count of 5 style blocks is unchanged.
The .is-fk marker must be kept because slick-grid.spec.ts reads it.
The review load-error Retry button uses the dialog-danger/xs variant, so its height, radius and hover tint differ from the old rule.
bg-error/12 mixes in oklab whereas the old rule used srgb; the difference is imperceptible.
The antialiased utility also sets -moz-osx-font-smoothing, which has no effect in Chromium/WebKit.

### v2.2 P214 Memory manual add, free text: Add memory dialog gets a single free-text box (no per-row fact/reason; reason auto-fill... (Done)
The Add memory dialog (AddMemoryDialog.vue) has a single free-text box with a 1000-character cap and a counter, replacing the per-row fact/reason UI.
The Add memory dialog sends one item with a fixed reason of manual; the user does not enter the reason.
Manual add submits through the unchanged store path: the gate splits the text into atomic facts, challenges and reconciles them, and a memory is stored only when every step passes.
The free-text manual add has no dependency on P211.
The P214 change touched only the dialog UI: the challenge block and outcomes list are unchanged, and there is no Go, store-path or model change.
The memory-module Playwright test covers free-text input and two outcomes.

### v2.2 P215 Test and hook speed regression: tests and the pre-push hook (go build, lint:go, lint:dead) got much slower in roughly... (Done)
The test and pre-push slowdown had no single cause: several costs grew and one test helper booted twice.
The test helper openPlan used to pass no clock to relaunch, then install the clock and reload, causing two full boots (108 calls across 17 space specs); it now passes clockTime.
The typecheck:* scripts run with --incremental, using one tsBuildInfoFile per project under node_modules/.cache/tsbuildinfo (git-ignored); injected type errors are still reported.
check-theme-classes.sh first runs one combined alternation pass per family on default-scope names; zero hits skips about 110 per-name greps, and any hit runs the unchanged per-name checks, with output and exit code identical to the old script.
The 43 MB root kira-space binary was untracked, and /kira-space and /kira-studio are now git-ignored.
Warm typecheck dropped from 41 s to about 18 s with no change or a leaf edit, but a cold typecheck stays about 41 s.
Studio UI tests (~590 s) and the rest of the suite are CPU-bound (3.9x on 4 cores) because each test opens a fresh WebKit page and answers every RPC via page.route mocking (20 to 130 ms per fulfil).
Replacing page.route mocking with a local mock server was judged a test-infra redesign, not a regression fix, so it was not done.
Mobile tests hit a real local server, with a 1.0 s median.
The warm pre-push hook takes about 11 s; a cold go build takes about 97 s because of wails cgo, and only after a cache wipe.
TS project references (composite, vue-tsc -b) would dedupe 583 files shared across programs, but were not done and would be their own phase.

### v2.2 P216 Memory speech to text: local English-only Whisper small.en quantized q5_1 (whisper.cpp ggml) in a subprocess worker s... (Removed in P224)
P216 designed Memory module speech to text as local English-only Whisper small.en quantized q5_1 (whisper.cpp ggml) in a subprocess worker started only on demand and stopped when idle, like memory-embed.
P216 mic dictation in the Memory module showed live text in the input; the user sent it manually. The model downloaded on click with a pinned SHA-256.
The P216 speech-to-text feature for the Memory module was removed in P224 because the user dropped speech to text.

### v2.2 P217 Code review (one Opus round) and fixes (Done)
In mobileterm, phone input no longer holds the entry lock across the PTY write; a separate write mutex is used, and a deadlock test covers it.
In mobileterm, Serve re-checks device and permissions after Attach.
The mobileterm ring buffer grows lazily up to 1 MiB.
mobileweb maintain polls addresses each minute and rebinds on change (new leaf, listeners added and removed, status event via OnStatusChanged).
The mobileweb agent session route and SSE no longer include cwd.
mobileweb Publish skips marshalling when there is no subscriber.
In the importer, skipped directories count as one ignored entry without walking them; the dialog copy reads "files and folders ignored".
Biome rules are turned off for tests and shadcn names.

### v2.2 P218 Speech engine without a C++ build: step 1 measures build-free engines (sherpa-onnx prebuilt libs first) against the w... (Cancelled (user dropped speech to text))
Plan v2.2 P218 (speech engine without a C++ build) was cancelled because the user dropped speech to text.
Plan P218 would measure build-free engines (sherpa-onnx prebuilt libs first) against the whisper.cpp worker, then swap in the winner and delete fetch-whisper.sh, the whisper tag, cgo glue, CI patch and S13 whisper bits.
Plan P218 had to keep dictation behaviour, malgo capture, worker isolation, the pinned-SHA model store and a 400 MB RSS ceiling.
Plan P218 said that if no build-free engine won, stop and ask the user, never fall back to whisper.cpp.

### v2.2 P219 Terminal and API collections: terminal module scripts get collections added the same way as the API module; right-cli... (Done)
Quick-command collections are stored in the custom_script_collections table (Studio migration 0033, Space migration 0023).
Quick-command collections are created, renamed inline and deleted like API collections; they are ordered by creation, and deleting a collection cascades to its commands (API parity).
Both the terminal and API modules have a "Move to collection" context submenu, implemented by the shared moveToCollectionMenu.
API MoveItem moves a request or folder with its subtree to the root of another collection.
The quick-command dialog has a "Choose…" button that opens a native folder picker for the working-dir field.
Schema, Terminal module and API collections facts are documented in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md.
In the quick-command dialog the collection field is a select; new collections are created from the panel, not the dialog.
Collection collapse state is keyed by collection id under a new local-storage key; drag and drop is not supported for collections.

### v2.2 P220 Git module: graph lines still disappear on click and on scroll (find the root cause); default tab is Repos and the la... (Done)
CommitGrid seeded the graph width from laneCount at mount, before the layout worker answered; with 0 lanes the width was 17px, and the row SVG clips lanes past the column edge, so lane-0 edges and half of each node vanished.
Every new repo tab is a first-ever mount and hit the narrow graph width bug; restored tabs kept the persisted width and looked fine.
CommitGrid graph width is floored at 40px (heals persisted narrow values); the seed is deferred to the first layout with lanes and applied once.
useRepoPanelTabStore is backed by useLocalStorage('kira.git.panelTab', 'repos'). The GitPanel repoId watcher that forced the Files tab on every mount is deleted; the panel shows Repos while no repo is active.
Specs repo-graph-lines.spec.ts (pixel check of lane 0, first mount with click and scroll, restored tab with persisted 17px) and git-panel-tab.spec.ts (3 cases) cover the fixes and failed before them.
The repo-workspace (5 tests) and repo-graph-lifecycle (1) specs now click the Files tab after opening a repo, since Files is no longer forced.
Run test:webview and test:visual:space before merging changes to the graph seed path, because it is shared with the VS Code webview.

### v2.2 P221 Memory module: move the semantic-search model download and the Connect Claude Code action into Settings (Done)
Memory setup (semantic-search model download and Connect Claude Code action) lives in Kira Space Settings > Memory, not in the Memory module.
MemoryPane.vue composes ClaudeCodeMcpSection, SemanticModelSection and DictationModelSection, located in packages/workbench/src/memory/settings/; the dictation model download also moved to Settings.
useModelDownloadsStore keeps the download AbortController, so Cancel still works after Settings is closed and reopened.
The Memory module's plug button, Connect dialog and SemanticStatus were removed; MemorySetupHint and the mic popover link to Settings through MemoryModuleContext.openSettings.
Settings opened from the Add memory dialog (nested case) stays interactive.
Accepted limitation: a failed-download message is per component instance, so reopening Settings after a failure shows the download button without the error message.

### v2.2 P222 Git add-repo dialog: restyle to match the app's dialog design; per-repo colour choice like other places; explain and... (Done)
The Repositories (Git add-repo) dialog is Settings-shaped: header icon, ghost close, left nav with colour dots, a "Scan folders" nav entry, and a footer with Remove and Close; chip tabs and the corner close button were removed.
The Repositories dialog form is grouped into Repository, Worktrees, Branches and Deployment environments.
Per-repo colour is stored on the code_repos table (migration 0024), replacing the deleted repoColor() hashing.
Repo colour can be picked in the Repositories dialog and through a Colour submenu on Git panel repo rows.
Deployment environments track deployed commits: the environment command prints the SHA.
Adding an environment used to always fail because an empty script was rejected as "new-env"; now a draft row is written once name and command are filled.
No separate terminal setup hook exists for environments; Prepare worktree is the per-repo setup script and is described as such.
Test fixtures and specs gained color: 'none' for the new repo colour field.

### v2.2 P223 Mobile agents web as a plain-HTTP page on the trusted LAN only: drop the PWA, local CA, HTTPS and setup listener; bin... (Done)
The Mobile agents web is served as plain HTTP on the trusted LAN only, via one plain-HTTP listener on the trusted interface's IPv4; the PWA, local CA, leaf issuance, HTTPS and setup listeners, setup page and the pane's certificate step were removed.
The mobile web server accepts a peer only if it is a private or link-local IPv4 address inside the bound subnet.
The mobile web server binds exactly one address (no wildcard, no loopback) and rebinds when the address changes.
"Trust this network" records the subnet, router IP and router MAC; a 10 s supervisor then stops and starts the mobile web server by itself and shows the reason.
The pane shows a plaintext warning, the phone shows a one-line warning, and device tokens expire after 30 days.
The package internal/lannet detects the local network, using Linux /proc and the macOS route RIB.
The device cookie is named kira-space-device, and legacy CA files are deleted at boot.
There is no kick channel: Trust and Forget run one reconcile pass synchronously, so the returned status is current.
mobileweb.Config.IsLAN is an exported test seam because Start refuses loopback by default.
While the supervisor is off, the bridge Status reads the current network on demand, so the pane can offer Trust before enabling.
The old "Kira Space local CA" profile should be removed from phones.
The build:space-mobile output is index.html, favicon.ico and assets/, and contains none of randomUUID, serviceWorker, crypto.subtle, navigator.clipboard, isSecureContext or workbox.

### v2.2 P224 Remove speech to text completely: the `stt` package, whisper.cpp build, dictation bridge and stream, mic UI, P221's d... (Done)
Speech to text was removed completely: dictation UI and queries, the stt package, DictationService and stream, memory-stt shim, malgo, whisper.cpp build, S13, microphone plist strings, CI patch and docs.
modelstore, workerproc, the embed worker and the webview microphone deny were kept when speech to text was removed.
Space deletes the retired speech model models/whisper-small.en-q5_1-5359861 at startup via modelstore.RemoveRetired.
The modelDownloads store lost its kind parameter.

### v2.2 P225 Git graph regression (new since about yesterday, likely from P220's CommitGrid change): commits disappear from the gr... (Done)
CommitGrid applied the P220 seed width once, on the first layout with lanes, which covers only the first 500-row chunk; the column fit 2 to 4 lanes while the page needed up to 8, and the row SVG clips nodes past the column edge, so outer-lane commits lost their dot.
The CommitGrid auto width follows laneCount (grow-only, capped at the six-lane default, not persisted) until the user drags the column. The first lane-aware width may shrink the column from the 95px default to the lane width, as P220 did; only later steps are grow-only.
A branch-out edge into lane N that later converged into lane C had its toLane overwritten with C, so the record held no lane N and the run drew on the source lane over its own node line, making a merge's second-parent line vanish, worst after Load more.
EDGE_RUN_LANE is set at append and never patched; edgeCommand draws from fromLane, runLane and toLane. Output is unchanged for straight, branch-out and straight-then-converge edges.
Refresh or auto-refresh after Load more re-walks one page because Walk.Stream ignores resumeThroughRow after a reset, so loaded commits drop out of the list; this is behaviour since G16, accepted by P203.
UncommittedChangesStrip sizes its graph cell from columnWidths.graph (default 95), so it can misalign with an auto-sized column (since P92).
The webview renders the same rowSvg.ts as the Space UI graph.
The regression spec repo-graph-paging.spec.ts uses 2000 commits, 500-row chunks and two 1000-row pages with Load more, checking clipped nodes and stacked runs per visible row; lanes.test.ts also has a case covering one pass and paged.
The earlier specs missed the bugs: repo-graph-lines has one 300-row chunk and two lanes, no Space UI spec clicked Load more, and lanes.test.ts covered only straight-then-converge.

### v2.2 P226 Consistent colour bars: wherever the left panel shows an item with a coloured left bar (scripts in Kira Studio, git r... (Done)
Coloured left bars in the left panel (Kira Studio scripts, git repos, other module lists) use one shared bar component and tone mapping, so the same colour renders the same way everywhere instead of per-module variants.
colorMarkClass(mark, color) in packages/theme/src/connColor.ts supports marks rail, bar, dot and band; paint is literal bg-conn-* classes, not --kira-rail.
The canonical colour bar look is the Studio tree rail (2px, full row height, panel edge); Quick commands, Git panel repos and worktrees, and the Repositories dialog use it, and play and source-control icons no longer carry colour.
Tabs, view header dots and bands, Start recents, the op log cell and environment dots all go through the colorMarkClass map; the op log cell changed from an 8px square to the 5px dot.
The DataView header dot with 'none' now shows the ring like every other view.
scripts/check-theme-classes.sh guards against bg-(--kira-rail), and its retired-class replacement texts point to colorMarkClass.
A color-rails.spec.ts in both apps pins one class string and geometry; the connections, tabs and api-ui-consistency specs use bg-conn-* class checks instead of style assertions.
The pinned repo-graph tab stays unmarked, and ADE chips and view-header icon tints are unchanged.

### v2.2 P227 Code review (one Opus round, all three dimensions) of everything changed since the last review close-out `7f626e91a`... (Done)
Device expiry is enforced beyond request start: handleEvents ends at ExpiresAt via a timer, the terminal authorized callback checks expiry, and the one-minute maintain sweep (sweepExpired) calls DisconnectDevice and ReleaseDevice for expired devices seen by withDevice.
sweepExpired tracks devices with an in-memory id-to-expiry map rather than DeviceStore.List, so the DeviceStore interface is unchanged.
repoColorOf in repoLinks.ts follows the worktree anchor, and is used by tabKinds.ts and six ADE callers; GitPanel.vue needs no change because both its rails already paint the anchor row's colour.
The Space settings visual spec mocks memoryMcpStatus, because unmocked the Memory pane rendered a fixture error.
lannet.Find returns ErrNoRouterMAC for a missing ARP entry; evaluate's default branch maps it to mobileStopUnavailable with the error text.
The supervisor logs a start failure only once per distinct message.
Environment writes chain on one promise and build their list at run time.
useNow uses a 60 s useIntervalFn scheduler because this VueUse version has no interval option.
Edge kind was removed; EDGE_STRIDE is 6 and PATCH_STRIDE is 3, and tests assert lanes.
An expired device is covered as a row in TestAuth_Verdicts, so the two sub-bar tests were deleted.

### v2.2 P228 Git graph still broken after P225; user suspects resizing columns breaks it. Reproduce with real column resizes (ever... (Done)
Resizing columns broke the git graph in both WebKit and Chromium, from two deterministic causes.
Wide columns overflowed the viewport because computeMessageWidth floored the message column at 120px, so graph + author + date + 120 could exceed the viewport; SlickGrid sized the canvas to the sum and a sideways wheel scrolled the graph column off screen.
columnFit.ts computes effective column widths: author shrinks first, then date; the graph column never shrinks; drags stop at a 120px message column via handle :max.
Stored column widths are preferences only; effective widths are computed separately, and the viewport's overflow-x is forced hidden as a last guard.
Any graph column drag used to freeze the column below what later lanes need, because P225's growth only ran in auto mode; a drag, a restored view state, or a repo with 7+ lanes left the column too narrow after Load more.
A grow-only lane floor per mount applies in every mode; the six-lane auto cap is removed (12 lanes, 173px max), and the graph handle :min follows the floor.
CommitGrid emits graphWidth and App.vue binds it for UncommittedChangesStrip, which previously took the persisted width; the emitted width is not persisted.
P225's open item remains unchanged: Refresh after Load more re-walks one page, and it still has no row.
R1 and R2 in repo-graph-paging.spec.ts cover resize, wheel, click, window shrink and Load more; columnFit.test.ts covers shrink order, minimums, compact, auto vs user graph width and drag maximums.
fitColumns takes graphAuto already combined with "lane floor known"; the caller passes laneFloor > 0 && graphAuto.
effectiveGraphWidth is exported so the graph formatter reads the same rule without a layout read per cell.
The overflow-x guard is written as Tailwind @apply kv:overflow-x-hidden! because biome flags a literal !important and its suppression does not apply inside Vue <style>.

### v2.2 P229 Git section (graph, toolbar, detail, stash and other git panes) looks different from the rest of the app: bring it in... (Done)
The Git section UI (graph, toolbar, detail, stash and other panes, including git UI inside Kira Space) follows the app's shadcn-vue/Tailwind look; see docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, Git module section, "Git module follows the app look".
Space surfaces in the git UI use the colour #1f1f1f.
Git commit rows are 28px or 22px high depending on the Appearance density setting; switching density applies live without remount.
Git badges use a 1px border plus a 15% tint and normal font weight.
Git toolbars, search rows and the review toolbar use the ViewToolbar recipe; banners use Alert; empty panels and placeholders use Empty.
Every codicon in the git UI is rendered via CodiconIcon at 13px, not a raw codicon span.
Git menus use rowVariants 'menu' and 'tree', with one-line items, muted 13px icons and trailing detail.
Git detail meta uses px-3 py-2 padding with a muted "Show more".
15 git dialogs follow the recipe of header close button, padded body and Cancel-first buttons.
FileTree indent is 8 + depth * --kv-tree-indent; the host setting is kept, so Space shows 8px per level while the app tree shows 14, because no Space source for the setting exists.
Separator height is h-3.5 because h-control-inline is a kv:-only spacing name.
Git tree directory rows have no folder icon, only a chevron, as they never had one.
The cell padding change also covers CELL_PADDING_PX (date probe), and the strip SVG uses 100%/50% instead of a measured height.
graph-columns.spec.ts (webview) asserts the 0.15 tint on tag badges instead of a transparent badge.
Badge contrast of fg #cccccc on the 15% tint in dark theme is above 4.5 everywhere: 7.3-9.2 (lanes) and 7.6-8.9 (kinds) over --kira-bg; 5.5-7.4 and 5.6-6.7 over bg-select.
Linux visual baselines git-graph, git-graph-detail and git-stash-dialog live in git-module.spec.ts-snapshots/; commit times are set 3.5h before the run so relative dates stay stable.

### v2.2 P230 Agent module Refresh broken: shows 'never fetched' then a git error. Find root cause, fix, add regression spec. (Done)
The board used to open repos with the raw git.gitPath setting, empty by default, so exec.Command("") failed on every open; the board read fell back (chip 'never fetched') and Refresh returned 'exec: no command'.
The board now opens repos with GitStatus().Path; TaskBoardDeps.GitPath was deleted.
Every ADE test harness set GitPath to 'git', so no test caught the empty git path bug.
A repo with no remote now skips only the fetch instead of returning a NoRemote error row; the rest of the refresh runs and the chip reads 'no remote'.
git writes FETCH_HEAD per worktree, so lastFetchAt must stat FETCH_HEAD in the worktree's own git dir (Summary.GitDir), not the common dir.
repoFacts sets remote and lastFetchAt before collectRepo, so a later failure cannot read as 'never fetched'.
TestTaskBoard_notCreatedAndTooOldGit warms the cache with openRepo first, because the first board call came after the status switch rather than being cached before tooOld.
The regression test for G1 sets GitStatus to the absolute exec.LookPath("git") instead of the GitPath override.
With Git executable path empty, chips show a time (e.g. '5m ago') for fetched repos; Refresh all shows 'fetching…' then '<n> refs changed' or 'no changes', with no red text.
For a repo with no remote, the refresh tip reads 'Rescan … (no remote to fetch)' and clicking gives 'no remote · no changes' without red styling; a bad remote URL still shows a red classified message.

### v2.2 P231 Real-flow tests for every main flow of Kira Space, split at the IPC (bridge) level: Go-side tests drive the bound ser... (Done)
Kira Space real-flow tests split at the IPC (bridge) level: Go-side tests drive the bound services against real git and real temporary git repos (no mocked git, default settings); TS-side tests drive the frontend against the real bridge contract.
Go flow tests live in internal/flows/{gitflow,repoflow,editorflow,adeflow,memoryflow,termflow,appflow,mobileflow}; there are also 15 e2e-real specs.
After a graph walk reset, graph.refresh following Show more restores the previously loaded rows: the reset remembers its loaded rows and the next graph.stream re-reads whole pages until the store holds them again, so a new commit shifts the last old row out.
The native git transport sends repo.open once per repo before the first request or stream naming it, so a reloaded Review pane, diff tab and Retry no longer run on a connection holding no repo.
In the -tags server build, EmitTo broadcasts to all clients instead of finding no window (internal/shell/emitto_server.go); the native build is unchanged.
For remote-only branch attach, ensureWorktree uses newBranch from <remote>/<name> (origin preferred), so the new branch tracks its remote.
Open repos honor a changed git.gitPath: Repo.SetGitPath exists, and the registry and TaskBoard.openRepo re-apply the live setting; tooOld still reads through an open entry.
SetPort reconciles whenever the supervisor is active, so a server stopped by a busy port retries on the new port.
The /api/ade/sessions endpoint passes results through withoutCwd, so cwd is stripped from what the phone sees.
Test harness: GhLocator (WithoutGh finds no gh); archive window closes go through the bound CloseWindow hook; appwire.Options has TrackerGrace and MobilePoll (WithTrackerGrace/WithMobilePoll), cutting the interactive session wait from 60s to 2s; scenario prompts rules cover gate, reconcile, extract per document, fail budget and hold.
The fake claude in tests emits no init line under json output and accepts inline --mcp-config.
The e2e-real fixture writes login-shell profiles, so no per-test workaround is needed.
The e2e-real fake claude read KIRA_FAKE_SCEN as JSON although the fixture sets it to a path, so every e2e scenario was ignored; fixed.
CommitGrid threw 'RowPlan.entryAt/storeRowAt out of range' when a click or scroll frame landed on an emptied plan, making repo-graph-paging flaky; fixed.
By design, the pathLocator PATH fallback, appearance.dateFormat reaching git only through app.init, and git-ui reading app.init git status only once a repo opens are unchanged.

### v2.2 P232 Real-flow tests for Kira Studio, same type as P231 (Go bound-service tests at the IPC level against real git/real ser... (Done)
gRPC Describe, Call and ServerStream bound waits: connect plus handshake ends at 5 s (the silent-server case), reflection at 15 s in total for a connected server, a unary call at 30 s; each fails with E_TIMEOUT naming target and wait.
GrpcCallArgs.timeoutMs overrides the 30 s unary call deadline; the UI has no field for it.
gRPC Describe takes an optional opId (not persisted); the schema query passes one and cancels it on abort.
gRPC streams stay unbounded (no deadline); Stop ends them.
The flow gRPC harness runs unary handlers through the server interceptor, so Calls() and WithRequiredMetadata cover unary calls as well as streams.
gRPC Service has a package-qualified fullName field so the UI can call services inside a proto package; short name stays for display, and the tab stores and calls by fullName.
createTerminalsStore keeps one terminalWrite in flight per tab and coalesces chunks typed meanwhile (state/orderedWrites.ts), with no timers, to keep per-key terminal writes in order.
The Docker exec store is built by the same createTerminalsStore, so one write queue covers Studio, Space and Docker exec terminals; packages/docker-ui/src/control.ts needed no change.
P232 flow tests live in apps/kira-studio/internal/flows/{apiflow,httpflow,grpcflow,dockerflow,termflow}; Docker flow tests skip with a clear message when no daemon is reachable, and KIRA_FLOW_DOCKER=require makes Docker mandatory (test:flows:studio:complete).
The docker-real e2e spec keeps the bash:5.2 image because busybox ash can swallow an Enter after a cursor-position reply; this is a test-side workaround, not related to B-1.
The flowServers fixture is per test, not worker-scoped, because worker scope leaked recorded requests between tests.
Do not remove shared state such as HOME in afterAll in e2e specs, because under fullyParallel afterAll runs between tests.
grpc-go strips the grpc-status header, so a unary gRPC spec must not expect it.

### v2.2 P233 Claude Code hooks only for sessions Kira Space starts: audit every place Kira Space or Kira Studio changes the user's... (Done)
Kira Space hooks for Claude Code ride a per-session temp file passed as --settings, plus KIRA_* env vars set only on Kira launches (internal/agenthooks).
No code writes hooks into ~/.claude/settings.json, project .claude/settings.json or .claude.json; earlier versions never wrote Kira hook entries into real settings, so no cleanup exists.
The hook shim exits 0 immediately unless KIRA_AGENT_HOOK_TOKEN and KIRA_TERMINAL_ID are both set, so a stray copy never reaches the server.
P233 scope was cut by the user to hooks only: no MCP injection, endpoint file, claudecfg package, or cleanup UI/migration; Kira Space "Register with Claude Code" and Studio Database MCP Install behave as before.
TestShimInertWithoutSessionEnv in internal/agenthooks runs the real shim against a counting unix-socket server to verify it does not reach the server without session env.
claudeflow.TestClaudeSettingsUntouched is a regression guard: with a fake HOME and seeded Claude config, mode and sha256 stay identical after a terminal agent session, an ADE session start and an app restart, and launch argv carries one --settings path outside the fake home.

### v2.2 P234 Docs refresh: update `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (incl. Parallelism, process wiring with `appwire`, stale git-pairing-real... (Done)
docs/ARCHITECTURE.md describes process wiring through appwire composition roots, with pointers to main.go.
Documented test inventory: 349 UI tests in 58 files, 7 e2e-real tests in 5 files, visual tests 13 for Studio (8 specs) and 8 for Space.

### v2.2 P235 Code review (one Opus round, all three dimensions) of everything changed since the P227 close-out `605f63e3f` (P228-P... (Done)
The gRPC unary deadline follows api.requestTimeoutMs (0 means no deadline), while the 5 s dial bound stays.
The timeoutMs setting is clamped to the range 0..3_600_000.
Host.Cancellable registers a Describe for CancelOp with no op events, and adds no Operations row.
describeSchema calls signal?.throwIfAborted() before dialling.
setColumnWidth rebuilds when leaving graph auto mode changes the drawn width, even if the stored width is unchanged.
F5 is not scoped per window, because adding window keys to three payloads plus listeners is out of proportion for a sandbox-only build; the limitation is recorded in docs/DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md.

### v2.2 P236 More real-flow coverage: audit every bound method and git stream request of both apps against the flow tests, add Go... (Done)
The bound-method and git-request coverage gate lives in flows/coverage/ and has 0 exemptions in both apps.
The e2e-real tests have a relaunch() fixture, used by the journey and restart specs.
P236 added Go flow journeys covering first run, restart and persistence, two windows, error paths, and parallel git streams.
AttachPush methods are no longer bound (F1).
Worktree preflight checks the checked-out branch (F2).
P236 fixed handling of a repo deleted while open (F3), DataGrip import MCP modes (F6), the gRPC reflection deadline (F7), and the Cause of a cancelled git run (F8).
InstallSemanticModel has no URL seam, so no hermetic offline test is possible for it; left unfixed (F4).
When claude is off PATH, the UI shows the shell's own error text; left unfixed (F5).
P236 root-caused the flaky specs repo-graph-paging "columns resized wide", ade-board-real and ade-v2-panel.spec.ts:239.

### v2.2 P237 Real `claude` test suite: opt-in only (`-tags realclaude` and `KIRA_REAL_CLAUDE=1`; never in default tests, hooks or... (Done)
The real claude test suite (P237) is opt-in and covers hook injection and payload contract, settings untouched, ADE headless runs and TUI stage sessions, memory MCP, install and gate, and Database MCP.
Real claude tests live in the nested modules apps/*/tests/claude/ and run by bun run test:claude* with no build tag and no env flag (moved there from tagged packages in P249).
The per-area table of real claude tests with commands and cost is in the "Real claude tests" section of docs/DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md.
Real claude tests use haiku with a tiny budget and never run in default tests, hooks or CI.

### v2.2 P238 Desktop notification when a Kira-started Claude Code session finishes (Stop) or needs input (permission or elicitatio... (Done)
Kira shows a desktop notification when a Kira-started Claude Code session finishes (Stop) or needs input (permission or elicitation Notification), and when an ADE headless run ends.
ADE headless runs have no hooks, so their end notification is driven by run state.
Each notification shows the repo or task name plus a bounded message; clicking it focuses the window and tab.
Notifications are suppressed while the session's tab is focused, and a cooldown applies.
Settings > Claude Code has per-kind notification toggles and a test button.
Notifications are native on macOS via the Wails v3 notifications service, and are a no-op on Linux and with -tags server.
Design facts for agent notifications (P238) are in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md under "Agent notifications (P238)"; the plan is plans/P238-plan.md and the result plans/P238-result.md.

### v2.2 P239 Claude Code usage limits (5-hour and weekly: % used, reset time) in the status bar, ADE module only. Default source:... (Done)
The ADE status bar shows Claude Code usage limits (5-hour and weekly: % used and reset time), in the ADE module only.
For interactive tabs, usage limits come from the rate_limits that Claude Code hands to a status-line command injected per session; the user's own status line is kept.
For headless runs, usage limits come from the stream-json rate_limit_event.
P239 scope: no account source, no credential read (OAuth token), no network call. The opt-in usage-endpoint fallback was dropped by user decision.
Design facts for P239 are in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md under "Claude Code usage limits (P239)"; the plan is plans/P239-plan.md and the result is plans/P239-result.md.

### v2.2 P240 One-step review from the ADE Plan: a Review code action on every task card, branch row, task and branch context menu,... (Done)
The ADE Plan has a one-step Review code action that opens the existing per-branch review window on the branch and its base, focusing an already open one.
Review code is available on task cards, branch rows, task and branch context menus, task and branch panel headers, and the review stage block, and via Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+R (ade.reviewCode) on the selected task or branch.
When a task has several branches, Review code shows a picker to choose one.
Review code is hidden for parked branches, and disabled with a reason for an uncreated branch or a branch with no commits on its base.
After Review code runs, focus returns to the invoking element.
P240 is frontend only with no internal/** product change, and reuses OpenReviewWindow.
The composable review/useReviewCode.ts is the sole caller of OpenReviewWindow; the rule lives in board/reviewCode.ts.
VarText chips render interpolated values, and menu hints accept parts and now show on disabled items and in submenus.
P240 is tested by tests/ui/ade-v2-review-open.spec.ts (11 tests), adeflow TestReviewOpenFacts, and e2e-real ade-review-open-real.spec.ts.

### v2.2 P241 Task base branch and headless rebase: pick the base (repo main default, any local or remote branch, or another planne... (Done)
When creating a task, the base can be chosen per task and per branch: the repo main default, any local or remote branch, or another planner branch to stack on.
The Change base action on a started task stores the new base and rebases the branch and its stacked children.
Rebase, Queue after and Change base share one button rule across tag, header and fix menu (no popup), and run as a headless Claude run through the run engine after the existing prompt dialog.
The headless rebase agent reports through finish_step with status done, failed or needs_input, plus reason, conflicted files, last git error and what it tried.
Kira Space verifies the rebase result in git rather than trusting the agent report, and synthesizes a 'no report' outcome on crash, exit or timeout.
The rebase outcome is decided from git state by decideRebaseOutcome.
The structured rebase outcome is stored on the run and shown on the board, panel, Needs you and the P238 notification, and served to other agents via the run_outcome MCP tool.
Abort rebase is an explicit action.
P241 depends on Streams A and C and on P240 (shared files).

### v2.2 P242 Part 1 Automations: rename the Terminal module to Automations (mode key, ids, tests, docs; real terminals keep their name);... (Done)
The Terminal module is renamed to Automations (mode key, ids, tests, docs); real terminals keep their name.
Every ADE run and every script run shares one run outcome: done, failed, blocked or cancelled, with source and reason.
Script runs in terminal tabs are recorded in a run store with live state and elapsed time, a runs list, Stop, Copy for agent, and a status bar count.
Each script has a working directory: a picked folder or the default <app home>/automations/<id>, never $HOME. Legacy rows keep $HOME with a notice.

### v2.2 P242 Part 2 Smart scripts: a script kind run as headless Claude (`claude -p`, stream-json log, schema-forced final report), AI ba... (Done)
Smart scripts are a script kind run as headless Claude (claude -p) with a stream-json log and a schema-forced final report.
Smart scripts declare params of type text, select, multi-select or secret, plus ADE variables in Space.
The smart script run dialog shows a task/branch popup on ambiguity and a full preview.
Smart scripts can be invoked from Automations, from an ADE task or branch, and as a workflow step.
The ADE worktree folder option for a script moved from P242 Part 1 to Part 2.
Studio has no ADE variables for smart scripts.
The Needs-you automation entry was dropped.
Studio keeps the report server name kira-ade.
Smart runs load no Claude settings files, so auth via env in a settings file is unsupported, as with memory.
P242 Part 2 plan is at plans/P242-part2-plan-iter2.md and its result at plans/P242-part2-result.md.

### v2.2 P242 Part 3 Scripts in ADE: ADE variables, task/branch picker popup on ambiguity, worktree-run toggle (script runs in the task wo... (Done)
P242 Part 3 adds scripts in ADE: ADE variables, a task/branch picker popup shown on ambiguity, and a worktree-run toggle so a script runs in the task worktree.
Normal scripts can be invoked from an ADE task or branch.
Workflows have a smart_script: step, and script runs use a run_outcome kind of automation.
The UI shows script runs in a task chip and a panel block, and sends a notification when a script run ends.
P242 Part 3 applies to Space only and runs after Part 2.

### v2.2 P242 Part 4 Recurring scripts: a cron schedule (5 fields, timezone, next 3 fires shown) on a normal or smart script; enable toggl... (Done)
A recurring script uses a cron schedule (5 fields, timezone, next 3 fires shown) and can be a normal or smart script, with an enable toggle and a run now action.
A due scheduled run shows a confirm popup by default and starts only after the user accepts; each script has a "run without prompt" option.
Every recurring script (normal or smart) has an overlap guard: if the previous run is still running or awaiting the accept popup, the tick is skipped.
A tick skipped by the overlap guard is shown as skipped with the reason in the runs list.
Missed runs (app closed at fire time) are skipped; scheduled fires happen only while the app is running.
Normal scripts run headless when scheduled.
Scheduled runs appear in the same run list as other runs, with a scheduled trigger.

### v2.2 P243 Part 1 Drop the VS Code extension, prep: carry test coverage off the extension and `git.sock` before deleting them. Audit ev... (Done)
P243 Part 1 is the prep step for dropping the VS Code extension: it carries test coverage off the extension and git.sock before they are deleted, and deletes nothing.
P243 Part 1 runs after P242 Part 4 and after Stream A (P236) has landed.
Every internal/gitsock Go test and every extension webview interaction/layout spec was audited and classified as transport-only, already covered, or uncovered; uncovered ones were ported to native-stream flow tests and Space ui specs.
The graph-chunk golden fixture and the git stream perf tests were moved to the native stream.
P243 Part 1 added native-stream flow tests (gitflow, reviewflow) and ported 38 Space ui tests off the extension webview suite.
The P243 Part 1 audit covered 136 gitsock rows (a 46, b 30, c 59, p 1) and 64 webview titles (a 5, b 7, c 52); the coverage gate has 0 exemptions.
Part 2 inherits one p row from the P243 Part 1 audit: the AcquireLock test in internal/config/lock_test.go.

### v2.2 P243 Part 2 Drop the VS Code extension and the git server it uses: delete `apps/kira-space-vscode`, `internal/gitsock`, `internal... (Done)
P243 Part 2 removed the VS Code extension (apps/kira-space-vscode), the git.sock server (internal/gitsock), internal/gitvsix, GitClientsService, the Connected editors pane and pairing dialog, and the .vsix build and packaging.
The git_clients table was removed via Space migration 0031.
P243 Part 2 dropped extension-only contract surface: worktree.prepare*, host capabilities, HostKind, settings.changed, connection.changed, injected params, socket channel, RPC server, base64 encoding, and the stream allowlist.
Leftover git.sock files are removed at startup.
P243 Part 2 raised the contract version from 45 to 46 and deleted 151 files; both coverage exempt.txt files are now empty.
P243 Part 2 did no restyling; restyling is deferred to P245.
release.yml fails at its version step until docs/pending-changes/.github__workflows__release.yml.patch is applied, because the extension manifest it stamps no longer exists; the patch must be pushed from a session with workflow scope.

### v2.2 P244 Docker page polish: Terminal tab must not auto-open a session (explicit 'New session' button), fix the overlapping te... (Done)
Docker page Terminal tab opens a session only when the user clicks the 'New session' button, not automatically.
Docker page left side list no longer shows CPU and RAM; the detail header and overview still show them.
Docker page engine dropdown text no longer overlaps (fixed).

### v2.2 P245 Git module visual alignment: make the git module look exactly like the rest of the app, using only Tailwind and mostl... (Done)
git-ui compiles in Space's Tailwind root, using only Tailwind with mostly default values so the git module looks like the rest of the app; the kv: prefix, second Tailwind root, --vscode-*/--kv-* layer and vscode-bridge.css were removed.
theme/git.css is the only remaining custom styling in git-ui.

### v2.2 P246 Popup routing across windows plus system notifications: route every app-originated popup or prompt by origin through... (Done)
Every app-originated popup or prompt is routed by origin (origin window key or none) through one central Go prompt router and one shared frontend host.
A window-triggered popup shows in the window that triggered it.
A generic popup (no originating window, e.g. cron, MCP, background script or agent event) shows only in the main window (lowest-order real, non-ephemeral window), never in every window and never duplicated.
If no window is open when a generic popup fires, it is queued for the next window open or focus.
Each popup also fires a system notification through the P238 sink; clicking it focuses the right window and popup, and answering or dismissing the popup anywhere clears the notification.
Prompt routing covers Space and Studio; Studio has no ADE or cron windows, so it applies only to its existing prompts.
P246 depends on P238 and P242 Part 3 and lands after both.
The single prompt router handles the schedule confirm, Database MCP approval, git credential, mobile pairing and update popups, plus system notifications.
P246 changed the git stream contract from version 46 to 47.
Prompt routing design facts are documented in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md under "Prompt routing (P246)".

### v2.2 P247 Workflow branching overhaul: an agent step declares its results (each ok or not ok, with a route: next step, a later... (Done)
In workflow YAML, an agent step declares its results, each ok or not ok, with a route: next step, a later step, an earlier step, itself as a bounded loop, end of stage, or stop.
finish_step takes exactly one of the step's declared results, enforced by a per-run schema enum that also includes needs_input.
The engine routes on the result chosen in finish_step, with per-edge loop limits.
Existing on_failure workflows and task snapshots work unchanged after the branching overhaul.
The workflow Form editor is a graph editor built on Vue Flow (MIT), with no up/down buttons.
In the graph editor, edges are green for ok, red for not ok, and neutral when both results lead to the same step.
The step result and route are shown on the board, panel, Needs you and notification.
Launch failures no longer auto-retry.
Design facts for workflows and the run engine are in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md under "Workflows" and "Run engine".

### v2.2 P248 Paste credentials into DB connections (Studio only): a Paste credentials panel in the connection dialog (fields mode,... (Done)
Studio's connection dialog has a Paste credentials panel, available in fields mode for non-file connection kinds.
A saved fields-mode network connection has an Update credentials item that writes only username and password, keeps the other fields, and reconnects a live connection.
Pasted credentials text is parsed in the renderer only, as labelled key/value text with separators such as colon, equals, ->, whitespace, tabs and newlines, and with quoted values.
The paste parser accepts key aliases: user/username/login/uid/role/account, pass/password/pwd/passwd/secret/token, and host/port/database/db/dbname/schema/service/sid.
The paste parser also recognises .env/env-var lines (PGUSER=, DB_PASSWORD=), plain DSN Key=value; strings, and CLI flags of psql/mysql/redis-cli/mongosh (-u -p -h).
Passwords containing separators are kept intact by label-based value rules in the paste parser.
The paste parser does not support URL/URI/JDBC, JSON, YAML or percent-decoding; the user cut these.
Before applying pasted credentials, the review step shows recognised fields, a masked password with reveal, a candidate picker and a guessed badge.
Never log, store or send the pasted credentials blob over the bridge; clear it when the dialog closes, because it holds secrets.
P248 (paste credentials) is a frontend-only change and added the shell-quote 1.10.0 dependency.

### v2.2 P249 Split e2e-real at the IPC level, Claude suite separate. Take the existing e2e-real specs (`apps/*/tests/e2e-real`) an... (Done)
Each existing e2e-real scenario (apps/*/tests/e2e-real) is split at the IPC level into a backend flow test (real Go services behind the real wire) and a frontend UI spec (real UI against the recorded/typed bridge contract) asserting the same result.
e2e-real is kept only for what cannot be split, such as real containers and real window/OS behaviour.
UI mock responses must derive from or be checked against the real Go response shapes, to guard against contract drift.
Real-claude tests are a separate suite with their own directory/package and own bun run script, not a build tag plus KIRA_REAL_CLAUDE env flag.
The real-claude suite is opt-in by absence from every default command, hook and CI.
P249 updated the 'Real claude tests' table in docs/DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md and the CLAUDE.md bullet to reflect the separate real-claude suite.

### v2.2 P250 E2E coverage of the v2.2 additions. Runs after P249 and the two code-review rounds, before the docs update. Make sure... (Done)
Cover every new v2.2 functionality with e2e tests that exercise the real backend and the real frontend together; tests may split at the IPC level (real Go services behind the real bridge, real UI), with real containers where needed.
P250 coverage work audits first: list each feature against existing flow/e2e-real/UI specs, write the gaps list to plans/, then fill the gaps without duplicate coverage.
Keep the flow-coverage gate exempt.txt empty.
Keep tests that use real claude opt-in.
P250 iter2 filled the P252-P260 coverage gaps; gaps are in plans/P250-iter2-gaps-P252-P260.md and the result in plans/P250-iter2-result.md.

### v2.2 P251 Update Wails to latest. Bump `github.com/wailsapp/wails/v3` (`go.mod`), `@wailsio/runtime` (`package.json`) and the `... (Done)
The wails3 CLI pin is derived from go.mod by scripts/setup.sh.
P251 bumps github.com/wailsapp/wails/v3 (go.mod), @wailsio/runtime (package.json) and the wails3 CLI pin to the latest v3 release, with API/binding-generator fallout fixed and bindings regenerated.
The result of P251 is documented in plans/P251-result.md.

### v2.2 P252 Docker storage metrics and origin icons. On-demand only, never autoloaded: engine-wide used space (`/system/df`: imag... (Done)
Docker engine-wide used space (/system/df: images, containers, volumes, build cache, per-volume sizes) is fetched on demand only, never autoloaded; the last result is cached with its timestamp, and a Refresh action re-fetches it.
Per-container Docker size (SizeRw/SizeRootFs) is fetched on demand and cached in session memory only, never in the DB.
The Docker storage metrics are engine-generic (local, Colima, Docker Desktop, OrbStack, remote) and use Docker API data only; host free/total disk is out of scope.
In the left bar, Compose project groups get a Compose icon, and container rows get origin icons inferred from labels (devcontainer, Testcontainers, kind, Kubernetes, Swarm, buildx).

### v2.2 P253 Docker container edit. Edit a container (running or stopped) in two sections so the user sees what applies in place a... (Done)
Docker container edit works on running or stopped containers and splits changes into two sections: applied in place, and requiring container recreate.
Docker container edit applies in place, via ContainerUpdate, ContainerRename and network connect/disconnect: resource limits (CPU shares/quota/cpuset, memory/swap/reservation, blkio weight, pids limit), restart policy, name, and extra network attach/detach with aliases.
Docker container edit changes to ports, env, mounts, image, cmd/entrypoint, labels, user, hostname and caps require recreating the container: inspect, create with the new config, remove the old.
Recreating a container for edit sits behind a confirmation that lists what is lost, such as anonymous volumes and the writable layer.
The Docker container edit feature is engine-generic and uses only the Docker API.
The P253 implementation lives in Go under internal/docker/ and UI under packages/docker-ui/src/; architecture is documented in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md ("Docker module").

### v2.2 P254 Automations script editor rework. Remove the duplicate create entries from the Recurring menu (New script / New smart... (Done)
In the Automations Recurring menu, the duplicate create entries are removed; New script and New smart script each exist once.
A schedule for an automation script is enabled only inside the script editor.
The script editor dialog places the Collection field right after Name.
The script editor dialog has three tabs: Script (name, collection, script or prompt body and the rest), Parameters, and Schedule.
Inside the script/prompt body, variable autocomplete suggests declared parameters and interpolated variables while typing.
Previews keep the resolved-variable VarText visibility rule.

### v2.2 P255 Linear workflow graph editor. The P247 graph editor is small, crowded and hard to follow: lock the layout (no node dr... (Done)
P255 is a linear workflow graph editor redesign because the P247 graph editor is small, crowded and hard to follow; all editing capabilities are kept, and task detail (AdeStageBlock, not the graph) is untouched.
The P255 graph editor locks the layout: nodes cannot be dragged, and dagre owns the layout and re-runs it on every edit.
The P255 graph editor flows in one direction only, top to bottom, with stages stacked and steps ranked inside them.
In the P255 graph editor every node is the same size, with truncated content and detail shown in the inspector.
The P255 graph editor has no zoom (wheel, pinch, double click and buttons are off), uses native vertical scroll only, and fits its width to the pane.
In the P255 graph editor the main success path is a straight spine, results: branches fan out to the side with labelled edges, and loops are dashed edges in a left gutter.

### v2.2 P256 Git module design audit: check git-ui against the app's shadcn-vue primitives, tokens, spacing, density, radii, type... (Done)
The P256 git module design audit checks git-ui against the app's shadcn-vue primitives, tokens, spacing, density, radii, type and colours (Studio, workbench, docker-ui, theme) using real screenshots, and fixes every gap found.
P256 fixes in git-ui: dialog forms use Field, the detail tree matches the app tree, toolbar/search parts are shared, Badge/Alert replace one-off chips and notices, tertiary text tone and picker text scale are aligned.
P256 removed no behaviour from the git module; it was a design-only audit.
The P256 plan is in plans/P256-git-ui-design-audit.md and its result is in plans/P256-result.md.

### v2.2 P257 Drop line add/remove counts from the git module. Per-file and per-commit added/removed counts are noisy and useless e... (Done)
Per-file and per-commit added/removed line counts are removed from the git module UI, because they are noisy and useless.
Stop spawning git --numstat where counts were its only purpose (Space gitsession fileChanges/NumstatArgs, incremental.go, preflight stash preview); keep numstat only where something else needs it (e.g. binary/rename detection), to be decided in the plan.
Per-file status indicators (added/modified/deleted/renamed/copied/type-changed/unmerged, rename original path, similarity) must be kept; they come from --name-status, not numstat.
CombineFileChanges (apps/kira-space/internal/gitclient/porcelain/difftree.go) currently drops files lacking a numstat row and takes IsBinary from numstat; the merge is to be rewritten as name-status only, with the plan deciding the source of the binary flag.

### v2.2 P258 Git module in Kira Studio's design language. P245 and P256 restyled git-ui, yet it still looks very different from th... (Done)
The git module (packages/git-ui) must use the same elements, spacing and design language as Kira Studio (apps/kira-studio/frontend, packages/theme, shared packages/workbench parts).
The git module must take nothing from the Agents/ADE module or Space's explorer; re-ground in Studio anything earlier passes copied from there.
P258 mirrors the Studio recipe in git screens: Studio Badge tones, single-line rows, connection-palette lanes, Studio view head, Studio popover list rows, no semibold, and Empty component for empty states.
In git-ui, the kv- marker layer is replaced by data-testid.
For P258, delete git-only styling rather than adding more.
The Studio recipe for each git screen (toolbar, pickers, commit graph rows and badges, detail head and meta, file tree, dialogs, menus, empty states, banners, view head, Space diff/file views) is recorded from real screenshots and computed styles.
P245 and P256 restyled git-ui, but it still looked very different from the app, which motivated P258.
P258 is implemented after P257 lands, and shares packages/git-ui with it.

### v2.2 P259 Git repo hiding and remove-repo placement. (1) Hide repositories in the git module, both for repos imported one by on... (Done)
P259 adds hiding of repositories in the git module, for repos imported one by one and repos imported through an entire folder; a repo can be hidden from a folder import without removing it.
Hidden state of git repositories is persisted engine-wide in the Space DB.
P259 moves the Remove repository button into the repository view, in the panel that owns the repository (repo panel/header menu), styled as part of that panel instead of a generic-looking button.
P259 changes Space only, with no change to packages/git-ui or git-ipc.
P259 runs after P258; its plan is plans/P259-hide-git-repos.md and its result is plans/P259-result.md.

### v2.2 P260 Docker module polish (user-prioritised, ran ahead of P261). Edit tab: two tabs In place / Recreate instead of per-fie... (Done)
Docker module Edit tab splits changes into two tabs, In place and Recreate, instead of per-field coloured badges; it has a neutral dirty dot, a pending summary, a per-tab Apply, and keeps the recreate confirmation.
Docker module has an image registry button in the Images view and in container detail next to the image name; the URL is derived from the tag/RepoDigests per registry and opened externally via a Studio LinkService; local-only images get no button.
Docker module: the Compose icon uses the Compose brand colour, start is green and stop is red everywhere, and there is no blue selection bar.
Docker module shows container size in the Stats view.
Docker module left-panel section tabs use the git module's ToggleGroup.
Automations row Run icon moves to the right, like Docker's row actions; this is a final commit group applied after P254 lands because of shared AutomationsPanel.vue, specs and baseline.

### v2.2 P261 Git graph broken after P258. Real-stack repro (5.3k-commit repo, WebKit) and bisect name `765a0fc85` (P258 single-lin... (Done)
P258 single-line rows (commit 765a0fc85) broke the git graph: badges moved inline, undoing the user's own badge line (G-UX 2b).
A half-width overflow-hidden strip around non-shrinking badges cut badges mid-label and hid later refs and the +N chip in the git graph.
P261 restores the badge line above the subject in the git graph: decorated rows are taller, plain rows are 28px.
Git graph badges shrink with ellipsis and the +N chip stays visible.
The pre-existing (P93) empty graph column while history streams was caused by #rebuildLayout publishing the row plan before its layout lands; P261 fixes it.
P261 adds realistic-history UI specs for badge geometry, lanes during stream and persisted widths, and re-records the git-graph and git-graph-detail snapshots.

### v2.2 P262 UI unification across both apps and every module. Decide one design first (dialog sizes sm-2xl, header/body/footer, b... (Done)
P262 unifies UI across both apps and every module: dialog sizes sm-2xl with header/body/footer, button roles, stacked form fields, 22/26px control densities, 400/500 font weights and icon sizes.
P262 uses one SecondaryTabs component for both secondary tabs and segmented pickers.
P262 foundation puts shared primitives in packages/theme and adds scripts/check-ui-primitives.sh with per-stream allowlists.
P262 is applied on 2 streams with zero file overlap: Stream A covers Studio, Docker and shared workbench modules; Stream B covers Space, mobile and the git module.
P262 left/side panels share one panel look (header, sub-bars, rows, indent, states, empty, resize), added via a foundation addendum before the streams branch, even though panels differ in functionality.
P262 is behaviour-neutral and keeps testids stable.
P262 made every look decision in the plan, leaving none for sign-off; the plan is at plans/P262-ui-unification.md.
P263 unifies the remaining element families after P262 (tables/lists/tree rows, badges, checkboxes/switches/radios, tooltips, toasts, loading states, alerts, context menus, scrollbars/split handles, cards, kbd hints, colour/status tokens, focus rings, mobile), and starts only after P262 is fully implemented.
P263 runs on 3 parallel streams (A, B, C), not 2.
P263 unifies all pane resize handles: AdePanelResizeHandle must match the shell handle in thickness, hit target, gap, idle/hover/drag colours, cursor, focus and keyboard.
ADE keeps its VueUse resize mechanics per P132, with the shared visual provided by one class/variant; this supersedes the P262 close-out's 4px ADE handle.

### v2.2 P263 UI unification part 2: remaining element families. Starts only after P262 is fully implemented (foundation, addendum,... (Done)
P263 (UI unification part 2) starts only after P262 is fully implemented (foundation, addendum, both streams, close-out).
P263 follows the same loop as P262: an Opus plan that inventories and decides every look (final, no sign-off list), a sequential foundation (shared primitives, base changes, guards with per-stream allowlists), 3 parallel streams with zero file overlap, then close-out.
P263 uses 3 parallel streams (A, B, C) instead of 2, because the user lifted the 2-stream cap.
P263 covers these element families: tables/grids/lists/tree rows outside side panels; badges, chips, status pills; checkboxes, switches, radios; tooltips; toasts; loading states; alerts, inline errors, validation messages; context menus and dropdowns; scrollbars and split handles; cards and panels; kbd hints; colour tokens and status colours; focus rings and disabled states; and mobile equivalents.
P263 is behaviour-neutral and keeps testids stable.
P263 addendum: all pane resize handles are unified; the ADE handle (AdePanelResizeHandle) must match the shell handle in thickness, hit target, gap, colours (idle/hover/drag), cursor, focus and keyboard.
AdePanelResizeHandle keeps its VueUse mechanics per P132, and the shared visual comes from one class/variant.
The P263 addendum supersedes the P262 close-out's 4px ADE handle.

### v2.2 P264 Behaviour unification and modularisation. Starts only after P263 is fully implemented. Same loop: Opus plan, sequenti... (Done)
P264 (behaviour unification and modularisation) starts only after P263 is fully implemented.
P264 goal: inventory behaviour implemented ad hoc in many places, extract shared composables/primitives into the shared packages, migrate callers, and add guards.
P264 work structure: Opus plan, sequential foundation, 3 parallel streams (A, B, C) with zero-overlap ownership, chunks of <=25 files, 3 worktrees off one base, then close-out.
Each worktree needs sh scripts/prepare-worktree.sh, and only about 4 GB of disk is free, so the plan must stage worktrees and disk usage.
The P264 seed list of duplicated behaviours is rough, not an audit; the planner must audit with codegraph_explore across both apps and all packages and hunt for more.
The P132 reka nested ResizablePanelGroup hang is avoided, not root-caused; P264 must decide whether to root-cause it or move all resize handles to one implementation.
The P264 plan is at plans/P264-behaviour-unification.md; its results are in the Foundation, Stream A/B/C, Test and gap-fill result and Close-out sections.

### v2.2 P265 Copy unification and i18n. Starts only after P264 is fully implemented. Same loop: Opus plan, sequential foundation,... (Done)
P265 (copy unification and i18n) starts only after P264 is fully implemented.
P265 audits every user-visible string in both apps (mobile included) and all packages: labels, tooltips, placeholders, aria-labels, empty states, errors (Go-side messages shown in UI included), toasts, dialog titles, and strings outside .vue templates (TS, Go-sent messages, menus, native dialogs, mobile).
P265 produces a glossary with one term per concept (e.g. Delete vs Remove, Cancel vs Close, Create/New/Add, Settings vs Preferences) and style rules (sentence case, ellipsis on actions that open a dialog, punctuation, error phrasing, tone), recorded as a doc.
All user-visible text goes into ONE message catalog file; the planner decides the layout (e.g. one namespaced en.json/ts) and how both apps and packages share it.
i18n is wired with vue-i18n by default so locales can be added later; the planner must confirm licence and fit or name the requirement that rules it out.
P265 adds a lint guard against literal user-visible text in templates and against keys missing from the catalog.
Specs asserting on text are updated in P265, and testids must stay stable.
P265 follows the same loop as prior phases: Opus plan, sequential foundation, 3 parallel streams (A, B, C) with zero-overlap ownership, chunks of <=25 files, close-out. The plan lives at plans/P265-text-catalog-i18n.md.
In P265, streams only implement (including writing every planned spec), with typecheck and lint per commit and no expensive suites; foundations are parallelised where files are disjoint; repo-wide edits are sequential at the end; after landing, one serial test-and-fix agent runs all suites.

### v2.2 P266 Cross-cutting consistency audit. Starts only after P265 is fully implemented. Same loop: Opus plan with decisions, se... (Done)
Phase P266 is a cross-cutting consistency audit that starts only after P265 is fully implemented.
P266 follows the usual phase loop: Opus plan with decisions, sequential foundation, 3 parallel streams (A, B, C) with zero-overlap ownership, chunks of <=25 files, 3 worktrees off one base, and close-out.
Each P266 worktree needs sh scripts/prepare-worktree.sh; with about 4 GB free disk, the plan staggers worktrees and disk use.
The P266 goal is to find and fix cross-cutting inconsistencies, decide one convention for each, migrate to it, and add guards.
The P266 seed list is rough, not an audit: the planner must audit against the current tree with codegraph_explore across both apps, Go and all packages, and hunt hard for more. Accessibility is out of scope.
The P266 seed areas are: icons (same action, same icon, one icon set, icon-per-concept map); the Go-to-UI error model (codes like E_NOT_FOUND and E_CONFLICT, message shape, retryability, where shown); bridge API conventions (naming, argument/result shapes, pagination, cancellation, streaming, hash-guard conflict pattern).
Further P266 seed areas: the settings model (where settings live, naming, defaults, how to add one, instant-apply vs Save, screen layout, Studio vs Space); motion (durations, easing, transitions, spinner timing, prefers-reduced-motion); Studio vs Space parity for shared modules (Git, Docker, Settings, workbench shell), found by diffing for forks.
Further P266 seed areas: window and native behaviour (app menu, native dialogs, notifications, window state restore, quit confirm, update flow, macOS differences); persistence conventions (DB schema naming, IDs, timestamps, migrations, on-disk formats, where each kind of state lives); first-run, empty and onboarding states per module.
Further P266 seed areas: code conventions (file/folder naming, stores, composables, test helpers, Go package layout, enforced by guards); performance budgets and when to virtualize.
P266 must collect every parked item from the P262, P263, P264 and P265 plans and close-outs (permanent exemptions, out-of-scope notes, findings files, "not fixed"/"deferred" entries) and triage each: fix, justify the exemption, or record it as a known open item in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md.
Permanent exemptions live as named lines in scripts/check-ui-primitives.sh and as permanent lines in the stream allowlists; findings files are named like P264-stream-*-findings.md.
The P266 plan is at plans/P266-consistency-audit.md.
In P266, streams only implement (including writing every planned spec) and run typecheck and lint per commit, not expensive suites. Foundations are parallelised where files are disjoint, and repo-wide edits run sequentially at the end.
After P266 lands, one serial test-and-fix agent runs all suites.

### v2.2 P267 UI leftover unification. Starts only after P266 is fully implemented. Same loop: Opus plan, parallel foundation, 3 st... (Done)
P267 (UI leftover unification) starts only after P266 is fully implemented.
P267 work is split into 3 streams (A, B, C) with zero-overlap file ownership, chunks of at most 25 files, and 3 worktrees off one base; each worktree needs sh scripts/prepare-worktree.sh.
Only about 7 GB of disk is free, so the P267 plan staggers worktrees and disk use.
P267 unifies gaps found by four audits: plans/P267-audit-ui-leftovers.md (18 unify-now items and 11 decisions), plans/P267-audit-exemptions.md (unify 60 unifiable exemptions, fix 12 stale ones, shrink the PERMANENT block), plans/P267-audit-dim-visual.md and plans/P267-audit-dim-behaviour.md.
The P267 audits ran at tip 36eb6b80d, so the planner must re-verify every count on the current tree with codegraph_explore.
The audits' recommended conventions are FINAL decisions for P267, with no sign-off list; guards are to be added.
P267 deletes packages/kira-ui if AutocompleteField moves to PointPopover.
The bridge method connectionsReorder has no UI caller (dead or unbuilt); P267's plan must decide whether to delete or build it.
In P267, streams only implement (including writing every planned spec) and run typecheck and lint per commit, with no expensive suites; foundations are parallelised where files are disjoint and repo-wide edits run sequentially at the end.
After P267 changes land, one serial test-and-fix agent runs all suites.

### v2.2 P268 Code review round 1. Starts only after P267 is fully implemented. One Opus reviewer (all three dimensions per `CLAUDE... (Done)
Code review round 1 (P268) starts only after P267 is fully implemented.
P268 uses one Opus reviewer covering all three dimensions per CLAUDE.md, reviewing everything changed since commit 761fdf502, the final commit of the last review session (code review round 2 result).
The review base commit must be stated in the findings file plans/P268-findings.md, which is committed before the fixer runs.
P268 fixes are done by one sequential Sonnet fixer that commits per logical group; the findings file is deleted once fixed.

### v2.2 P269 Code review round 2. Starts only after P268 is fully implemented. Same as P268, same base commit `761fdf502` (round 1... (Done)
P269 (code review round 2) starts only after P268 is fully implemented.
P269 uses the same base commit 761fdf502 as P268, because round 1's fixer commits are unreviewed code.
P269 writes its findings to plans/P269-findings.md; a review round that finds nothing real says so.

### v2.2 P270 Docs update. Starts only after P269 is fully implemented. Update `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md`... (Done)
Phase P270 (docs update) must start only after P269 is fully implemented.
P270 updates docs/ARCHITECTURE.md and docs/DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md for P267-P269, writes SPEC result sections, and prunes stale content (dead pointers, resolved Known open items).
Docs are written in the terse style defined in CLAUDE.md.

### v2.2 P268-P270
docs/ARCHITECTURE.md had its Known open items section pruned in P270.
The remaining open items in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md are kept either for P277 or as accepted limitations.
<!-- /chapter v2.2 -->

<!-- chapter v2.5 -->
## v2.5
Source: docs/v2.5/ at b811de651f56. 26 phases.
P272 (data model) is the base of P273-P276.
Prompts go first rather than last, following the order of the user's list.

### v2.5 P271 App prompts: one file, visible and editable in Settings. Today every LLM prompt is a Go string constant beside its ca... (Done.)
All app LLM prompts are centralised in a registry of 85 entries (Space 61, Studio 33) in internal/llmprompts/registry.go.
Prompt overrides are persisted in <home>/llm-prompts.json.
Space and Studio each have a Prompts section in Settings, backed by LlmPromptsService, where prompts can be edited.
The prompt registry package is named internal/llmprompts so it does not clash with internal/prompts (the P246 popup router).
The checkprompts guard runs in bun run lint to prevent prompt strings living outside the registry file.
User-authored text (smart-script bodies, workflow stage prompts) is excluded from the app prompt registry.
The override store must be readable by every consumer, including the memory-mcp stdio subprocess, which runs the gate outside the app process.
Saving a prompt in Settings validates that required template variables are present and the template parses; a prompt bound to a JSON output schema keeps its schema fixed and only its text is editable.
Each registry entry has an id, title, owning app, purpose, default text and declared template variables; composed prompts are templates over named variables (text/template by default).
Callers read the effective prompt through one function, with no prompt string left outside the registry file.
Known open item: the ADE workflow graph baseline shows the Preview placeholder.

### v2.5 P272 Memory data model: nanoid ids, origin, session, scope, groups. Today `memories` (`internal/memory/migrations/0001_mem... (Done.)
Memory fact ids are nanoids with a km_ prefix at lineage level; the id cited by a comment or doc stays stable across versions of one fact (migration 0004).
Migration 0004 gives existing memory rows km_ nanoid lineage ids; legacy ids such as <uuid>-v2 still resolve through Lineage.
Memory origin has three states: user (user decided it, human-challenged, correct), agent (agent concluded it, reference only), and external with a required source tag such as slack or jira (correct but probably incomplete).
The store_memory tool asks the writing agent who decided each fact; origin is required with no default.
Memory scope is one of company (company-wide), project (with the project named), or personal (the user decided it; not binding on others).
A memory fact can belong to groups (session, task, document, external thread or other kinds); the memory_context MCP read tool takes a fact id and returns its immediate context, the sibling facts of its groups.
The Claude Code session that added a fact is captured from the CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID environment variable, which a stdio MCP server started by claude -p --strict-mcp-config receives and which equals the run's --session-id.
uuid.NewString is now used only for requestID and import ids; fact ids come from gonanoid in ids.go via newFactID in commitFact.
The Go test adapters/clickhouse fails with -count>1 by design because of shared container state; this is owned by P277 and listed as a known open item in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md.
P272 (the memory data model) is the base of P273-P276.
P272 depends on P271, whose file supplies the gate prompt (gatePrompt).

### v2.5 P273 Memory text formats: code comment and doc file, grep first, human second. (1) Fact style: facts and reasons short, su... (Done.)
P273 memory text formats are grep-first, human-second: facts and reasons are short, succinct and easy to read per CLAUDE.md "Communication style"; the gate rewrites accepted facts and reasons to that style without changing meaning.
The comment format is a strict text form of one or more atomic facts, each with its reason and its nanoid, citing other facts or docs only by id.
The store_memory prepare flag runs the same split, challenge and wording pipeline but persists nothing and returns the facts formatted as code comments.
The doc format serialises facts over plain .md and .txt repo docs: a metadata header at file start for grep (ids, scope, project, origin, session or source, group, keywords), then facts each with id and reason, readable by a human.
A formatted memory file re-ingests by parsing alone, with no LLM (P274).
Both formats use one fact per line or fixed line block, stable line prefixes and ids as plain tokens, with no Markdown emphasis or other syntax in fact or reason text that breaks a literal grep, and no repeated boilerplate per fact, so an AI reads them efficiently.
Each format has one regex, and a validator command usable as a git hook in any repo checks that every comment or doc in scope follows the format; scope marking keeps legacy comments from being flagged.
P273 is implemented as memfmt comment and doc formats, the store_memory prepare flag and the memcheck git hook; it depends on P272 (data model), which is the base of P273-P276.
memcheck hook install uses renameio.WriteFile instead of os.WriteFile, because TestGoConventions G4 flags os.WriteFile.
Claude receives the structured JSON (status, comment, prepared) for tool results, not the text content, so the grep-first meta text and the prepared line reach Claude only where a client reads text.
memcheck --install-hook writes an executable pre-commit hook; it blocks an orphan km_ fact line without a kira-memory header (exit 1), passes legacy comments, and exits 1 printing the hook line when a foreign hook exists.
The memory formats, regexes, style rule, Prepare/asComment, memory-check and grep-first MCP text are documented in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md; the real-claude row (mcpserver/**, memfmt/**) is in docs/DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md.

### v2.5 P274 Memory ingestion by file path; external sources; docs emitted in the P273 format. Today P211's importer (`internal/me... (Done.)
P274 adds MCP tools ingest_files and ingest_status: the agent passes a file or folder path plus origin, source tag and scope; content never travels through MCP, so it costs no tokens.
The ingest tool only instruments: it starts a job and returns its id; the status tool reports progress and result.
External data (Slack, Jira, ...) is first extracted to a text file (md, json, txt), then ingested by path with origin external and its source tag; its facts are not challenged back to the user.
The ingest pipeline is chunking, extraction, then a memory-module cross-check of every questionable fact against the source file in an isolated step with file access, then storing. Each ingested file becomes a group (P272).
A file already in P273's doc format ingests by parse only, idempotent by id. After first processing the module can write the doc back in that format.
The UI import (ImportView.vue) uses the same engine as MCP ingest and shows MCP-started jobs.
The cross-check step runs the claude CLI with --restricted --tools Read,Grep --allowedTools Read,Grep --max-turns N --permission-prompts none. --safe-mode is kept off for the tool call, as MCP calls do.
Without --restricted, claude's Read of an absolute path outside the cwd is not denied, so --safe-mode --tools Read,Grep --allowedTools Read,Grep does not isolate file access. --restricted confines file tools to the working directories and denies the outside Read.
Variadic claude flags (--tools, --allowedTools) swallow a trailing prompt argument, so the prompt must be sent on stdin, as memory.Call does.
Ingest jobs cap job groups at 4; the file's own document group takes the fifth slot (memory.CheckJobGroups).
Start takes a flat MemoryImportStartArgs, and an empty origin keeps the job's provenance. ImportAction no longer has start; the UI starts jobs through useStartImport.
Group ids are generated per run, so contracts mask groupId and the UI mask reader blanks masked values. The ingest spec injects fixed group ids instead.
The memdoc file kind is labelled "Memory doc" in the UI.
flowharness.Main already serves memory-ingest through RunArgvShim, so the detached runner needed no main_test.go logic change.
Seed Call.Files with renameio.WriteFile, never os.WriteFile, because TestGoConventions rule G4 rejects os.WriteFile.
The adapters test ConsoleResultCap op id now carries the row count, because reusing one op id for its cap+1 and cap runs made ClickHouse reject the second with QUERY_WITH_SAME_ID_IS_ALREADY_RUNNING.

### v2.5 P275 Memory ranking: real scoring, meaningful full-text and vector fusion, recall bias. Today `Service.Search` (`internal/... (Done.)
Service.Search in internal/memory/hybrid.go fuses bm25 full-text hits (searchFTS over memories_fts: fact, reason, keywords) and cosine hits (semanticHits), with normalised per-source scores, field weights, an agreement bonus and a recall bias.
Before P275, memory search used plain reciprocal rank fusion (constant rrfK) with no score cutoff, default limit 25, max 100, and matches tagged keyword, semantic or both.
Memory ranking is biased to return more rather than less: wider candidate pools per source, a generous default limit, and no hard cutoff that drops a plausible match.
Search results expose score parts so an agent and the Memory module can see why a fact ranked.
A fixed evaluation set of 20 query cases over a seeded 72-fact store (keyword-only, paraphrase, mixed, project-scoped) guards ranking; 32 same-topic fillers feed the recall case, and the seed store holds a fifth, personal fact so the scope filter bites.
Semantic score calibration uses QueryFloor 0.55 and QueryCeil 0.70 for arctic-embed-s-int8; ceiling is about the paraphrase max (a near-certain match). Unrelated cosine p90 is 0.550 and paraphrase median 0.602, so a floor/median rule would give a 0.05 band and a near-binary score.
searchFTS keeps its []Memory shape for reconcile, while the new searchFTSRows returns bm25 scores; vectorTopK takes a filter value; match.go gains matchTerms.
Flow and UI contracts for memory search send canonical scope order (company, project) and empty arrays instead of null.
searchSchema, with closed-set enums for scopes and origins, is wired into the memory search tool registration.
Memory search uses a decoded-vector cache keyed on (model, dim, count, max seq); it costs about 1.5 KB per fact resident.
Migration 6 adds index memory_embeddings(model) so the cache stamp count is index-only, because a table-wide count(*) over memory_embeddings is slow (blobs make rows wide); Search no longer calls embeddingCounts twice.
Search benchmark p50 after the cache and index: 77 ms at 20k facts (budget 150 ms) and 434 ms at 100k facts (budget 600 ms), versus 252 ms and 1261 ms before.

### v2.5 P276 Memory MCP docs: short, clear, say what is expected. Today `kira-memory` `instructions` and tool descriptions (`inter... (Done.)
P276 rewrites the kira-memory MCP server instructions, every tool and argument description, and the remember prompt for the final tool surface: store with origin, session, scope and group; comment-format flag; ingest by path and status; context lookup; search.
The memory module extracts and splits facts itself, but every submitted fact must come with its reason, who decided it (user, agent, or external with source) and its scope, so the data is complete even when poorly formatted.
Content files are ingested by path, never inline.
Memory MCP docs and tool descriptions follow CLAUDE.md "Communication style" and are kept no longer than needed.
The kira-memory instructions and tool descriptions live in internal/memory/mcpserver/server.go; docs/ARCHITECTURE.md section "Memory MCP server and module" describes the memory MCP.
The instructions Files line says: "Never read, open or paste the content, not even to check it", because an agent once used Read on the docs file.
The project argument (store_memory items.project, ingest_files project) is described as a project key host/owner/repo, such as github.com/acme/billing, never a bare name, because an agent sent project:"billing".
TestMemoryMcpFollowsDocs is a real claude test checking that an agent follows the new memory MCP docs. Its ingest cancel is best effort and logged, because the ingest job often finishes first.
P272 (data model) is the base of P273-P276, and P276 depends on P272-P275.

### v2.5 P277 Known open items cleanup. Fix these `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` "Known open items", then delete each entry as it closes. (... (Done.)
The Space review window sync popover is fixed; the ade-v2-review spec uses a real click instead of dispatchEvent.
sql-schema D3 flakiness was fixed by pasting text instead of using keyboard.type (failures 36/40 to 0/40 under load).
tooltips a11y flakiness was fixed with a fake clock (20/40 to 0/40); refsChanged also uses a fake clock (0/40 after fix).
Space repo-graph first paint under heavy load remains open: scroll test fails 8+/40 at 8 loops and 8 workers (row 0 wait 5-11 s vs 1.3 s idle), paging 9/48, columns 3/400, workspace 4/252; all pass idle.
Go TestScheduleADE is fixed: the fake agent writes its counter atomically and claims call numbers atomically (0/40 failures under load).
TestUnaryDeadline was fixed in product code, not just in the test.
TestDescribeCancel was only made deterministic (it waits for the connection, no sleep); no product-side reproduction was found.
Two Studio ui-timing tests fail idle in the WebKit sandbox by 1-12 percent (for example perf.spec.ts frame p95 89-96 vs budget 80, tree expand p95 58 vs 50, keystroke p50 55 vs 50); the item stays open and no budget was changed.
The ui-timing failures are attributed to WebKit in the sandbox running JS about 1.8x and DOM about 2.9x slower than Chromium; Chromium passes with margin and no hot-path change was found.
The registry button no longer links local images to Docker Hub when the containerd store keeps a RepoDigest: ImageRegistry is lazy and checks the containerd store plus Hub.
The semantic model download base URL is injectable via an EmbedSpec option, with a flow test for install.
A missing claude CLI is detected before launch with toolexec.ResolveClaude, so Kira shows its own error instead of the shell's raw text; contracts are machine-independent.
Unhiding an imported repo during a folder scan is no longer re-hidden, using a hidden_rev compare-and-set.
adapters/clickhouse tests at -count>1 are fixed by isolating state per run; mongo, redis, s3, sqs and kafka reset on rerun; MySQL and MariaDB run ANALYZE on all seeded tables.
The memory ingest scan raced the auto-start rule; the scan and rule now run in one transaction.
Studio Wails bindings are regenerated with wails3 task common:generate:bindings and are gitignored.
Out of scope by user decision for P277, entries stay open: quit discarding unsaved edits; visual baselines recorded in the sandbox; English-only backend, git-core and @vue-flow text; no timing budget is reduced.
Never run Go test suites under nohup, because children inherit an ignored SIGHUP and two internal/terminal Close tests fail; this is not a product bug.
The load repro recipe for flaky-test investigation is in docs/DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md under "Load repro recipe".

### v2.5 P278 Git graph commits go blank (regression). Symptom (user report): commits in Space git graph go blank on click or scrol... (Done.)
In packages/git-ui/src/components/CommitGrid.vue, handleChunkLayout must repaint the grid synchronously (grid.invalidateRows() plus render()), because a plan watcher fires on a Vue microtask and a click or scroll in that gap reads stale rows and the commit rows go blank.
The P278 fix repaints the grid synchronously inside a single plan publish step, so no gap exists between plan publish and grid repaint in which a click selects the wrong commit.
Git graph refresh swaps the list in a staged way anchored on the commit sha, so the live list and viewport stay stable across refresh.
A height-only resize of the git graph viewport had to be handled: before the fix, after Show more the host bottom sat 30px below the viewport bottom.
GraphOrderState skips malformed tip shas, because a ref with no object id made rowOfSha throw.
The permanent guard for P278 is the Playwright spec graph-blank-rows.spec.ts in Space tests/ui (ui project, mock-bridge native stream fixtures, multi-page history), with 4 tests covering load, scroll to end and back, click, Show more, refresh and the relayout race; it asserts non-empty subjects, non-empty graph canvas and row count equal to loaded count.
In graph-blank-rows.spec.ts, test 2 scrolls before freezeClock because a frozen clock fakes rAF, and resumes the clock after the refresh.
P278 required no Go change; the blank-rows cause was entirely in the frontend.
With history collapse on, the live collapsed row count after new commits equals a fresh page load (1319 before, 459 after in the 5000-row real-backend check); raw history stays 5000 rows.

### v2.5 P279 Resume stuck agent runs; quit confirmation. Today graceful quit kills agents (`b.ctx` cancel; run row stays `running`... (Done.)
Before P279, graceful quit killed agents by cancelling b.ctx and left the run row in status running.
apps/kira-space/internal/ade/recover.go marks running ADE runs as stuck at boot; internal/scriptruns Recover marks smart runs failed with a restart outcome.
RetryRun starts a fresh session, while TakeOver resumes in a TUI via claude --resume.
Recover keeps a resumable launch spec (stored claude session id as ResumeID) on stuck ADE runs and on failed-by-restart smart-script runs. A Resume UI action requeues the run via Launch.ResumeID with a resume prompt saying the previous session was interrupted and to re-check the state of the last action.
When agents are live, quit asks for confirmation ("N agents running; quitting stops them") through the shell quit flow (internal/shell/quit.go) and ConfirmDialog, in both apps where agents exist.
Known limitation: detached runners and PTY survival are out of scope. App crash or quit still stops the process; Resume restores the conversation but the turn in flight is lost, half-applied tool effects are possible, and the kira-db MCP stays app-bound.
P279 delivered Resume in both apps and a quit gate, with no detached runner.
The quit gate uses the shared prompts.QuitGate (internal/prompts/quitgate.go) instead of a per-app appwire.quitGate; the confirm dialog title is "Quit {app}?".
Smart-script resume code lives in internal/scriptruns/resume.go, split from service.go.
The EndResumeLost reason says "start it again" instead of "use Retry", because smart runs have "Run again" rather than Retry.
A resumed run's log does not contain the word "interrupted" because the CLI's synthetic tool_result stays in the transcript, so the real-claude test checks the shared Claude session id instead.
Deleting a transcript requires Claude's session id (Sessions claudeSessionId), not the ADE session row id.
Workflow YAML prompt: values containing an unquoted ": " cause a parse error and must be quoted.
Workflow YAML allowed_tools: ["Bash(sh:*)"] works, and the resumed run keeps the Claude session id.
In real-claude test rows with haiku, prompts must say the call is safe to rerun and to inspect nothing first, because haiku inspected state with ps, was denied, and stopped as blocked.
In ade-v2-resume.spec.ts, the Needs tab hides cards so the Plan tab must be opened first, and a refused Resume error renders in the step block (ade-stage-block-error), not the task panel.

### v2.5 P280 Presentation page (Astro). Decisions final: Astro plus Tailwind. Declined: Jekyll (Ruby toolchain, no components); Vi... (Done.)
The presentation page uses Astro plus Tailwind; this decision is final.
Jekyll was declined for the presentation page because of its Ruby toolchain and lack of components; VitePress was declined because its docs-centric theme fights a landing page. Both reasons go in the CLAUDE.md library rule.
The page structure stays compatible with a later Starlight docs install (P284).
The page is hosted on GitHub Pages at https://vlad-cirstean.github.io/kira-studio/ with Astro base '/kira-studio' and no custom domain.
A GitHub Action builds and deploys the page using actions/configure-pages, actions/upload-pages-artifact and actions/deploy-pages.
Workflows under .github/workflows/ cannot be pushed from the agent session, so the Pages workflow ships under docs/pending-workflows/ (per docs/DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md). The user copies it and sets repo Settings > Pages > Source = GitHub Actions.
The page is mobile-first and verified with Playwright at phone and desktop widths.
Screenshots are generated once with Playwright (not per Action run) from the real apps at a deliberately small window size so content stays readable on mobile, and saved in the repo's screenshots/ folder, used by the page and the root README.md.
macOS window buttons (traffic lights) are not in the screenshots; they are overlaid from a static svg or png asset.
The screenshot generation script is a documented dev command with deterministic fixtures and no credential reads.
Page content follows CLAUDE.md "Communication style", not README.md.
The site is an Astro 7.3.8 workspace in site/ with Tailwind 4 via @tailwindcss/vite and zero client JavaScript; bun run site:check runs 12 tests at phone 375 px and desktop 1280 px.
Six screenshots are produced by bun run screenshots, byte-identical across three reruns, 2.8 MB total with each PNG under 260 KB.
Space screenshot shots need fixtures for adeTaskRepos, codeWorkspaceRepoHeads, memoryImportJobs, memorySemanticStatus, memoryHistory and memoryContext, because each unmocked call causes an HTTP 422 console error.
The studio-api shot varied between runs because Monaco tokenizes JSON asynchronously and fades scrollbars on a JS timer; the shot now waits for coloured tokens and capture hides scrollbars.
captureShot framing uses a fresh context at scale 2, because browser.newPage pages own their context.
On the page, the hero shot is not repeated in the Studio section, and the header brand text is hidden below 640 px.
Dependency licences: astro, @astrojs/check and @tailwindcss/vite are MIT; sharp is Apache-2.0 (prebuilt libvips LGPL-3.0); both Fontsource packages are OFL-1.1.
The README references six framed images in screenshots/framed/*.png, each 2048 x 1280 with transparent corners.

### v2.5 P281 Code review round 1. One Opus reviewer over everything changed since the last review session, covering architecture a... (Done.)
Code review round 1 (P281) uses one Opus reviewer over everything changed since the last review session, covering architecture and security, functional correctness, and performance, per CLAUDE.md "Code review".
The P281 review base is the P270 docs update commit cbc60ea4a, which closed the P268/P269 review rounds; the planner states the exact base found in git.
Review findings go to plans/P281-findings.md and are committed before a fixer starts; the findings file is deleted once fixed.
In the review process, one Sonnet fixer commits per logical group of findings, followed by serial test-and-fix.
P281 resulted in six fixes (A1, A2, B1, C1, D1, E1) plus an A1 idle-claim guard test.
After P281, suites are green except two known frame-time specs that fail only under load.

### v2.5 P282 Code review round 2. Same cycle over the full diff since the same base, round-1 fixer commits treated as unreviewed.... (Done.)
P282 code review round 2 fixed three minor findings: the memdoc gate now holds when scope or project differs, chunk normalisation runs once per verify load, and the registry missing label is reset.
P282 code review round 2 reviews the full diff since the same base as round 1, treating round-1 fixer commits as unreviewed; findings go in plans/P282-findings.md.
A code review round with nothing real to report must say so in its findings.

### v2.5 P283 Docs update. Sonnet agent updates `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md` and SPEC results; prunes stale li... (Done.)
The P283 docs update covers docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md and SPEC results, pruning stale lines and resolved "Known open items" (including P277-owned items that P277 resolved).
P283 deletes the findings files after the docs are updated.

### v2.5 P284 Documentation site in the Astro page. End-user and developer docs inside the P280 Astro site; planner decides Starlig... (Done.)
Every docs page in the P284 Astro docs site must follow CLAUDE.md "Communication style": terse, substance only, no filler, about 20 words per sentence, imperative instructions, one term per concept.
A check script in bun run lint enforces mechanical docs rules: sentence length, banned filler words, invented abbreviations, arrows, emoji, decorative tables. A manual review pass is also documented.
The docs site lives inside the P280 Astro site under src/content; Starlight (MIT) is preferred over hand-rolled, and the planner decides.
Docs content derives from the real app: docs/ARCHITECTURE.md facts, Settings, MCP tools, P273 memory formats, P274 ingestion, P271 prompts. Screenshots reuse P280's folder.
Data-grid cell formats are text, json, xml, csv, sql, iso8601, epochSeconds, epochMillis, base64, hex; UUID and URL were removed in P42. Beautify applies only to JSON and XML.
Foreign-key navigation in the data grid works on PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB and SQLite; the popover opens a new tab, and editing goes through the cell menu.
Generate data excludes read-only connections.
SQL console explain applies to SELECT/WITH on PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and ClickHouse; auto-explain skips above 10 statements.
API client supports gRPC unary and server-streaming only; Postman export skips gRPC.
In git, Skip is offered for rebase, cherry-pick and revert, but not merge.
Agent no-report string is "no report: Claude ended without calling finish_step"; the stop option applies only to a non-ok result; the script stage has no steps.
Automation params are text, select or multi-select, each optionally secret.
Memory-format write-back is per job, skips doc sources, overwrites only a valid same-group doc, and leaves out facts with other provenance.
Per-engine capabilities: Redis edits string keys and deletes any type; ClickHouse insert only; Kafka produce; SQS send and delete; S3 file transfer with a key browser (PageKindKeyValue). Explain supports five SQL kinds, there are six mask kinds, and the pre-connect limit is 2000.
The database MCP server listens on loopback 127.0.0.1:8766 with no fallback on bind failure, uses a bearer token with 7 day TTL, and denies exposure by default.
Database MCP defaults: read allowed, write prompts, DDL denied; unclassified statements get the strictest mode. It has six tools, and masking is applied in render.go.
Git review hazard list is illustrative in code (worktree conflict, staged changes, untracked collisions, non-fast-forward, protected push). Snapshots use compressed blobs, text only (gitreview/store.go).
Git AI comments are added with the gutter +, listed grouped by file, support delete and clear all, and offer "Copy as prompt".
The third branch kind is parked: kept out of merge order and shown as Not merging.
The Studio Settings footer shows kira.sqlite, but the real file is kira.db.

### v2.5 P285 Part 1 Memory ingest quality evaluation. Autonomous experiment on the real memory-ingest pipeline (P274 ingest by path: chun...
P285 evaluates memory ingest quality as an autonomous experiment on the real ingest pipeline (P274 ingest by path): chunker, extraction and cross-check prompts in internal/llmprompts, importer in internal/memory/importer.
P285 goal: ingest output holds only atomic facts, loses nothing important, and is meaningfully shorter than the input.
The P285 corpus mixes phase plans (docs/v*/plans), spec files (Playwright/Go tests), other docs (ARCHITECTURE/DEV_ENVIRONMENT sections) and code comment blocks, covering prose, tables, code-heavy and JSON/JSONL input.
The P285 rubric, defined by an Opus planner, measures compression ratio (chars and tokens), fact recall against a hand-extracted gold list per sample (each gold fact marked essential or minor), atomicity, precision, duplicate rate and reason quality.
P285 atomicity requires one claim per fact, standalone, with no pronoun without a referent; precision requires no invented or unsupported fact.
The fixed P285 corpus manifest is committed under docs/v2.5/plans/P285-corpus/ so runs repeat.
P285 ingest runs go through the real claude CLI, which is opt-in, costs tokens, and must not read credentials.
Each P285 run is scored in a separate judge pass, which may use an Opus-class model through real claude, scripted under apps/kira-space/tests/claude or a scratch harness.
P285 iterates on prompts, chunk sizes and boundaries, the cross-check rule and dedupe until the planner's rubric thresholds are met or no further gain is found.
Every P285 iteration is committed with its scores so the history shows progression.
Prompt and chunker changes from P285 land in the registry and importer, with golden and unit test updates as needed.
The P285 final deliverable is docs/HISTORY.md (v2.5 P285) plus a published Artifact page, with a before/after table per sample, compression, recall, atomicity, example input/output pairs, what changed and why, and remaining weaknesses; real-claude rows are rerun at the end.

### v2.5 P285 Part 2 Terse memory prompts and distill tool. Decisions final. (a) Rewrite the memory-pipeline prompts in the registry (extr...
Memory-pipeline prompts in the registry (extract, finalize, verify, gate, reconcile) and the memory MCP instructions and tool and arg descriptions are rewritten as terse atomic instructions, one rule per line, same meaning, following CLAUDE.md Communication style, because every call pays the prompt tokens.
When rewriting prompts, keep template variables, schema and field names, tool names, negations, numbers, error strings and safety clauses (data hygiene, secrets) verbatim.
New memory MCP tool distill takes text or a file path and outputs only terse atomic facts or instructions, one per line in source order, with no ids, evidence, keywords, origin or scope; it writes nothing to the store.
The distill tool name is final unless the planner finds a clash.
distill keeps the source-stated rationale inline (X, because Y) for facts and prompt rules only when it is not obvious from the fact itself, and drops it when self-explanatory.
distill has a prompt mode that keeps rules as short imperatives with negations and numbers verbatim, because a plain fact extractor loses imperative force.
distill has a per-call size limit and a spend cap, is read-only, and is not subject to the write gate.
distill exists so any agent can condense long docs and prompts without the memory structure; P289 later uses it to rewrite the other registry prompts.
Memory import and distill are unified into one pipeline: distill is the base (text or chunk in, terse atomic lines out), and memory import is distill per chunk plus a memory layer on top.
The memory layer on top of distill covers chunk splitting, section from the heading path, provenance, source locator (path plus section), ids, gate, verify, dedupe, store and write-back.
There is no separate extract prompt or mode: the registry extract prompt is replaced by the distill prompt, and instruction-versus-fact handling stays an option of the same prompt, not a second pipeline.
The memory MCP exposes distill as a read-only tool over the same core as memory import.
The evidence quote is dropped unless it adds information, and the source locator is added by code.
Risks to measure for the unified pipeline: verify without the evidence quote (verifying against chunk text); the unresolved flag stays optional.
Fall back to the old split extract/memory pipeline only if measurements regress beyond the Part 1 noise bands.
The P285 eval is redone with the rewritten prompts: scores must equal Part 1 final within the Part 1 noise bands (R_ess, R_all, P, unsupported and duplicate rates, with C_fact not worse).
Acceptance for the rewrite: the real claude rows for memory import, ingest and MCP stay green and TestMemoryMcpFollowsDocs passes.
The total experiment cap for the P285 Part 2 eval is 30 USD.
A rewritten prompt that regresses is reverted and listed; before/after prompt sizes are recorded in chars and runes/3 tokens.
P285 Part 2 process: Opus plans, Sonnet implements, serial test-and-fix, close-out; the Memory Ingest Eval Artifact page and the site docs (memory and mcp-tools pages) are updated; the plan lives at plans/P285-part2-terse-memory-prompts.md.

### v2.5 P285 Part 3 Compact memory output. Decisions final. (a) Merge very closely related facts into one denser fact in the store step a...
Memory extraction (store step and prompt) must merge very closely related facts into one denser fact, because fewer facts shrink C_fact at little recall cost.
Memory output must drop the evidence quote unless it adds information, because the source locator is added by code.
Keep a rationale inline only when the source states one and it is not obvious from the fact itself; drop it when self-explanatory.
Part 3 compacts memory output because evidence and keywords grew the stored record past the source size (C_rec 1.06).
A new compact text format is required for code-comment blocks and .memory.md doc files: fact id once, no fact:, reason:, keywords: prefixes, a nicer layout; it must stay grep-first. The planner designs it.
Keep parse/format round-trip tests for the memory format. The planner decides migration or compatibility for existing P273-format files and stored data.
The new format change must update the memfmt parser and formatter, importer write-back, MCP tool descriptions and instructions, prompts, the site memory-formats docs page and ARCHITECTURE.
Part 3 experiments reuse the P285 harness with a TOTAL spend cap of 20 USD.
Part 3 targets: C_fact and the whole stored footprint (fact, reason and keywords as written to .memory.md; the C_doc measurement is to be fixed) clearly below Part 1, with R_ess not below Part 2's result beyond the noise band.
Part 3 process: Opus plan, one Sonnet implementer, serial test-and-fix with the real claude rows, close-out; the Artifact page is updated with Part 3 results. The plan is plans/P285-part3-compact-memory-output.md.

### v2.5 P285 Part 4 Distill in the UI. Decisions final. The Part 2 `distill` tool is also available in the Kira Space UI: paste text or p...
The Part 2 distill tool is also available in the Kira Space UI: paste text or pick a file or selection, get terse atomic lines back, copy them, and optionally send them to import or store through the normal memory path.
Distill in the UI is read-only by itself and is cancellable.
The Distill UI shows cost and size before and after (chars, runes/3 tokens). Cost is displayed via formatCurrency and the tokens share via formatPercent.
The Distill UI uses the same core as the MCP distill tool through a bridge service.
The Distill UI is built with shadcn-vue, Tailwind and TanStack Query per CLAUDE.md, and is placed with the memory panel.
Distill UI tests are split at the IPC boundary: a Go flow test, a UI spec and a visual baseline, plus one real-claude row.
The distill contract keys written to memory-distill.json are MemoryDistillService.Distill#done, MemoryDistillService.Limits, MemoryDistillService.ToImport#job and kira:memory:distill#progress.
Distill progress text reads "Parts done: {done} of {total} · {cost}" rather than "Part 1 of 1", because the total is known after chunking and done counts finished parts.
The busy E_CONFLICT test lives in TestBridgeDistillCancel because it shares the lock-release setup.
The Distill result is hidden while a run is in flight, to avoid a stale result beside new progress.
The selection UI test uses the Monaco palette (F1) rather than the context menu, because right-click collapses the selection in Monaco under WebKit.
A separate DistillProgress.vue component exists because rule U92 forbids a Spinner inside a Button.

### v2.5 P286 Review step in workflows. Add a review step type to the Space ADE workflow (smart workflow graph). When a run reaches... (Done.)
The Space ADE workflow (smart workflow graph) has a review step type that opens the existing git-ui review window for the branch of the run/card the user clicked, and the run waits for the user.
In the review window the user adds AI comments with a kind: change request or question; review comments use review.comment.* keyed by (repoId, branch).
Review step routing is configurable per review step and overridable per run: comments go either to a dedicated new agent session created for the review, or to a previous implementation agent session of the same task/run, resumed via its Claude session id using the P279 resume path.
The user chooses when review comments are sent via an explicit Send to agent action; the existing copy-for-AI action stays.
Agent replies, follow-up commits and answers to questions flow back into the review, with answers shown against the comment and comment states open/addressed.
The prompt distinguishing questions from change requests is a registry entry in internal/llmprompts, editable in Settings.
If the target session of a review is gone, the P279 EndResumeLost fallback to a dedicated agent applies.
The review step feature depends on P279.
The timeout field stays required on review steps.
A taken-over review round has no reply or finish tools.
P286 is covered by Go flow tests (7, fakeagent), UI tests, visual tests (2 new, 2 re-recorded) and real-claude tests TestAdeReviewStep and TestAdeReviewLost.

### v2.5 P287 Workflow agent sandbox (macOS Seatbelt). Workflow steps run agents under per-step filesystem restrictions via macOS `... (Done (Mac enforcement unverified).)
Workflow steps run agents under per-step filesystem restrictions via macOS sandbox-exec / Seatbelt profiles that Kira generates.
A read-only workflow step gets read access to one or more configured folders and no write access anywhere except its own scratch.
An implementation step gets full rights (read, write, create, delete) only inside its delegated worktree and nothing outside it.
Ad hoc headless agents (merge/rebase/conflict agents, smart-script agents) get write access only to their one worktree.
Sandboxed agents cannot create or remove branches or worktrees; git operations touching refs or worktrees outside the delegated worktree are denied, and there is no write to the main repo .git common dir beyond what the worktree needs.
Branch and worktree creation happen only through Kira MCP tools (e.g. create_worktree, create_branch) that run in the app, unsandboxed, and validate requests.
On Linux and Windows there is no Seatbelt: the sandbox policy is declared but not enforced, a clear notice is shown, and enforcement must never be pretended.
claude built-in permission flags serve as a second layer alongside the Seatbelt sandbox.
Keychain access is denied by default in the agent sandbox.
Because Seatbelt runs only on macOS, Go tests build and golden-snapshot generated SBPL profiles on every platform; the enforcement test is macOS-only (build tag) and proves denied writes/branch creation and allowed writes.
The macOS enforcement test is listed in the Mac checklist in docs/DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md.
P287 depends on P279 and the workflow step model.
P287 implemented the agent sandbox in new package internal/agentsandbox (policy, SBPL generator with golden files, darwin enforcer, deny watcher, goproxy allowlist).
Each workflow step has a sandbox block with access, read, allow and network settings; P287 also added fetch_remote and push_branch tools, a run badge and popover, a step inspector section, the ade.sandboxKeychain setting and migration 0037.

### v2.5 P288 Workflow step returns and single-surface step editing. A failed workflow step can return to a previous step. Planner... (Done (met as scoped by the plan).)
Workflow steps have a per-step max_returns setting; agent steps default to 3 (range 1..10), the review step defaults to 0 meaning no limit (range 0..10). It replaces the per-result max; legacy retry N and result max values fold into it, with no migration.
The workflow return counter is derived from back rows, so it survives app restart and Resume, and the run view shows it as a ↩ n/N chip.
When a step reaches its return limit, the run stops in a failed state with a message naming the step and the limit, using i18n key backend.space.ade.returnLimit.body.
The workflow editor has no strip row above the flow graph; add, remove, move, skip and Max returns are on the canvas and inspector, so one surface owns all step editing (less chrome).
The 'interactive step = 0 returns' default applies to the review step, because user stages have no steps.
Return-limit behavior is tested by Go flow test TestReturnLimit and UI spec ade-v2-return-limit, split at the IPC boundary.
P288 depends on P279 (Resume) and shares workflow files with P286/P287, so it runs after them.

### v2.5 P289 Terse LLM prompts. Rewrite every prompt in the llmprompts registry (`internal/llmprompts/registry.go` and fragments;... (Done (partly met: size target -3.5 % vs 25 % missed).)
P289 rewrites every default prompt in the llmprompts registry (internal/llmprompts/registry.go and fragments, including MCP instructions and tool descriptions) in the CLAUDE.md Communication style: fragments, no filler, imperative, one idea per sentence, same meaning.
Prompts are made terse because every call pays the prompt tokens and the user asked for caveman-short prompts.
When tersening prompts, keep template variables, schema names/fields, error strings, negations, numbers, and tool and field names untouched.
A prompt rewrite must not regress real claude rows (memory import/ingest/MCP, ADE, smart scripts) or the P285 memory eval harness subset beyond the P285 noise bands; revert a regressing prompt to its prior text and list it.
Prompt size is measured as a token estimate of runes/3, before and after, per prompt.
The prompt rewrite must keep the guards green: checkprompts, catalog rules, fakeagent keys and the prompt-count assertion. Only defaults change; user overrides stay untouched.
P289 depends on P285; the eval's extract prompt result from P285 is the starting text, and P285 Part 2's distill tool is used to condense the remaining registry prompts.
P289 shipped tooling: promptsizes -snapshot/-compare, promptdistill, and checkprompts style and size-budget rules backed by testdata/budget.tsv.
P289 rewrote 52 of 126 default prompts, cutting 30567 to 29507 chars (-3.5 %, -6.0 % over changed entries); it missed the 25 % size target because memory and workflow texts were already terse.
A bolder extract prompt edit (01c/01d) in the P289 eval exceeded the P floor and was reverted before shipping.
The P286-P288 prompts (14 new entries) were already terse and each has a budget.tsv line, so P289 changed none of them.

### v2.5 P290 Presentation page redesign. Decisions final. (a) Split the public docs presentation/landing page into two subtabs: St... (Done.)
The public docs presentation/landing page is split into two subtabs: Studio and Space.
The presentation page redesign keeps the theme (colours, fonts) but redesigns every element (hero, cards, sections, feature lists, screenshot frames), because the old look was too bland.
Studio screenshots use English for UI language and data names.
The Develop section is dropped from public docs entirely: nav entry, pages, links to it, docs-lint rules and sources frontmatter referencing it. bun run lint and site:check must stay green.
Docs follow the CLAUDE.md Communication style (P284 rule).
Space screenshot fixtures drop the Romanian identity too and were re-recorded, by user decision.
The hero Shot component takes a glow prop, and the hero gradient lives on main in Landing.astro rather than in AppHero, so no hard edge shows under the tab bar.
The intro band shows SITE.tagline; the availability line is the hero eyebrow.
The keyboard focus-ring test skips on the phone project.
The visual spec capture scrolls with behavior: 'instant' and uses test.slow(), because smooth-scroll caused instability.
Visual test baselines are Linux-only.

### v2.5 P291 Memory retrieval and unified import investigation. Decisions final. (a) Goal ranking from user: finding the right mem...
Memory goal priority: finding the right memory when needed first; extracting as many facts as possible second; storage size third, but stored text must stay smaller than source.
The old rule 'C_fact not worse' is replaced by 'stored text below source size, retrieval not worse'.
Unified pipeline makes distill the core of import (distill per chunk, code-built source reason, no evidence quote), with memory (reconcile add/update, verify, scope, origin, store) built on top: one versatile system, not two.
The unified pipeline in P285 Part 2 round p2-02 (commit 5866fd5e1) was reverted only because of the C_fact rule, not a technical failure. It measured R_ess 0.924, R_all 0.836, P 0.865, C_fact 0.549 vs ceiling 0.526.
Memory stores fact, reason, origin, scope and source locator; 'subject' and 'aspect' exist only as prompt wording (finalize merges same subject and aspect facts up to 300 chars; reconcile uses 'same subject').
Retrieval eval uses questions with known answer facts per corpus source (docs/v2.5/plans/P285-corpus) and measures hit@k and MRR on the real search path with the embedder ON, for keyword and vector search; the P285 harness had the embedder off.
Memory and distill output become telegraphic: only meaning-carrying words survive; negations, numbers, units, names and exact technical terms stay. Scope is the memory module prompts only; other prompts and MCP texts are out of scope.
No backward compatibility is required for the memory module because nobody uses it yet; destructive DB migration, memfmt format changes, re-importing memories and read-time grouping are allowed if they give better results (plan decision D32).
P291 adopted no pipeline or prompt change because all gates failed. The storage half target was not reachable at this recall: fact text was 0.43-0.50 of source and rendered doc 0.73-0.84.
Unified import (92e6cf609), V1T (5f987d0bb) and XT (35734574d) can be re-applied by reverting their reverts (608a3d1b4, 331452da6, 9c1f00a2b) if the user accepts the size trade.
P291 kept the retrieval, keys, telegraph and compare harness, internal/textloss, and docs. Variants A1 V1T, A2, A3, A4 (V1T and XT) and A5 were not adopted; prompts are back at the pre-P291 text.
The V1T and XT ports stay in git as commits 9b96da41f (V1T) and a487cbc18 (XT).

### v2.5 P292 Code review, 2 rounds. Decisions final. Per `CLAUDE.md` "Code review": one Opus reviewer covering (1) architecture/st... (Done.)
Per CLAUDE.md 'Code review', each review round uses one Opus reviewer covering (1) architecture/structure/maintainability/security, (2) functional correctness and business logic, (3) performance and resource efficiency.
The code reviewer only reports: it writes findings to plans/P292-review-round1.md and commits them before any fixer starts.
After the reviewer commits, one sequential Sonnet fixer commits per logical group of fixes.
Review round 2 repeats over the full diff since the same base, treats round 1 fixer commits as unreviewed code, and writes findings to plans/P292-review-round2.md.
A review round that finds nothing real must say so.
Review findings files are deleted once fixed; only still-open items are carried to docs/ARCHITECTURE.md 'Known open items'.
The review base is the last review session's final commit, found in git and stated in the findings file; scope is everything changed since.
P292 review scope includes P271-P291; P285 Parts 2-4 and P286-P291 had no prior code review.
P292 runs after P291 in table order.
P292 completed two review rounds with fixes landed; round 2 open items are recorded in ARCHITECTURE Known open items.

### v2.5 P293 Flat workflow steps and friendlier step panel. Decisions final. Today a workflow holds stages, a stage holds steps (a... (Done.)
The ADE workflow is a flat list of steps because the user found the stage-and-step model too complex; the word "stage" is no longer used in UI, docs, workflow files or code names.
P293 has no backwards compatibility (user decision, no users): old workflow files with `stages` are refused with a clear error, ADE task data is reset by one migration, and SQL columns are renamed to step naming.
The step configuration panel (inspector) has grouped sections, plain labels, sensible defaults first and advanced options collapsed, following shadcn-vue/Tailwind rules.
P293 tests are split at the IPC boundary: a Go flow test plus a UI spec asserting the same result.
P293 depends on P286-P288 and runs last, after P292; P292 code review rounds do not cover P293.
In the flat model, `since` in snapshots holds only the target step and later steps; TargetErr is lenient; a not-started task follows the live workflow file's first step; `snapshotStartedTasks` was removed.
The wire format dropped `Session.StageID`, `ReviewCandidate.Stage` and `RunOutcomeEntry.Stage`.
Engine `queueRun` was fixed so the attempt number bumps past history.
The `task_info` default text now says "step".
In the frontend, `canMove` blocks only explicit id routes, and Remove is disabled for a one-step workflow.
Step kind labels read "Agent step" etc., because of the catalog duplicate rule.
`AdeStepBlock` `reviewRows` still checks `step.id === 'review'`.
The UI spec `ade-v2-flat-steps` uses the contract for shape checks and fixture boards for UI state; `openWorkflows` lives in `support/adeV2.ts`.
Remaining uses of the word "stage" in the code are git/grid/update staging, the rejection message for old workflow files, and its docs mention.

### v2.6 P294 Test and CI speed. Goal: cut PR CI wall time and local test time sharply; planner decides every deferred point. Evide... (Done (CI half pending the pr.yml patch))
Workflow edits go through docs/pending-workflows/ (see docs/DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md); the pr.yml change is a pending patch at docs/pending-changes/.github__workflows__pr.yml.patch, to be applied from a Mac session.
The ui CI job is sharded into 4 shards by user decision, after first shipping with 2 shards.
The Docker image tar cache stays in CI: go-containers restores it and loads it in the background beside setup; the parallel pull script runs only on a cache miss, after which the tar is saved as before.
setup-go's go.sum-keyed cache is replaced by gomod-* (module cache) plus per-job gobuild-* cache entries; existing cache keys and paths are kept.
CI runs the full suite on every PR, with no path filters and no skipped jobs.
Git hooks scope to changed files; pre-commit is 0.5s for docs-only, 0.1s for Go-only and 56s for studio frontend commits, and pre-push for a Go-only range runs tests of the changed package.
Frontend commits get no hook speedup because the lint rules take 17s and the changed projects must typecheck.
The Ryuk image is not pulled because the go-containers job sets TESTCONTAINERS_RYUK_DISABLED=true.
scripts/pull-test-images.sh (run via bun run test:images) pulls alpine:3.20 and bash:5.2 under the mirror name only, and no longer creates a plain alpine:3.20 tag.
TestImageRegistryURL failed because a plain alpine:3.20 tag (from a manual pull/tag recipe) made the registry-link logic pick the implied Hub name; with that tag removed the test passes unchanged. It was not a containerd-store issue.
Running the app via nohup leaves SIGHUP ignored and shells inherited it, so terminal Close never hung them up; internal/terminal/session.go now installs a handler when SIGHUP is ignored at start so the exec resets it to default.
The Go 'under 30s cached' target is not met because the ade and i18n tests are never cached by go test.
CI estimates, not measured: run wall time drops from 15m47s to about 6 min warm (about 60% less), while billed Linux runner-minutes stay about equal (24.9 before, 23.8 after); cold-cache runs add about 1.5 min per job.

### v2.6 P295 Release flow speed; publish, not draft. Goal: cut tag-to-release wall time and publish the release directly. Evidence... (Done (pending the release.yml patch))
The release workflow .github/workflows/release.yml triggers on push of tags v*.*.*, runs jobs test-matrix and db-compat (ubuntu, timeouts 30 and 60 min) first, then the release job (macos-15, needs both, timeout 60 min) which builds, signs and packages.
P295 goal: cut tag-to-release wall time and publish the release directly (not as a draft), only after tests pass and assets are uploaded and verified.
Failure safety requirement: a failed gate must not leave a published release, and the handling of a bad tag must be stated.
Workflow edits must go through docs/pending-changes/ (see docs/DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md), so the release.yml change is delivered as a pending patch to apply.
P295 added a release gate script, scripts/release-ci-gate.sh, which supports --dry-run and has a dispatch path (exit 3 means it would dispatch, exit 1 means a failed run).
The setup action (.github/actions/setup) gained a cache-save option; the cache-save: true branch equals the old steps plus one && clause.
The new publish job fetches the DMGs with gh run download (needs actions: read) instead of actions/download-artifact, because no verified pin for that action was reachable.
release.yml has no dry run, so after-change release timings can only be measured on a real tag.

### v2.6 P296 Memory: code comments are plain comments. Decisions final (user, 2026-10-18). The memory tool never touches files and... (Done)
Code comments are plain comments, not memories: they carry no kira-memory header, no km_ fact lines, no tags, ids, keywords or provenance of their own.
A code comment may only reference a memory by its id; the id always resolves because the memory is stored the normal way.
The memory tool never touches files and never adds comment markers; the store_memory asComment flag was removed, so it no longer returns a marker-wrapped kira-memory block.
To condense text for a comment the agent uses distill (P297 merges it into memory).
The .memory.md doc format and import write-back stay unchanged in P296; P297 changes them.
Service.Prepare and the asComment flag were dropped, and memfmt no longer has the comment format.
memory-check flags retired comment blocks (exit 1 with the D3 message at the file and line); a plain comment citing a memory id like (km_7h3kq9x2mfa4) passes with exit 0.
The comment check was renamed to the check hook; the flow TestCheckHook contract is unchanged.
The memory MCP instructions must tell agents to cite the stored memory id in the code comment, because a real claude agent stored a memory but left no id in the comment before the reword.
The --print-regex flag help text was reworded because the old text named the comment regex.
Re-run the real claude rows of docs/DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md after prompt changes, because agent behavior depends on the prompt wording.

### v2.6 P297 Memory: distill collapses into memory; rules. Decisions final (user, 2026-10-18). (1) A memory can be a rule: a stand... (Done)
A memory can be a rule: a standing, general imperative with a reason, as durable as a fact.
The memories table gains a kind column (fact or rule); versions are immutable, so kind is fixed per version, and no other new metadata is added.
The gate (memory.gate.system), the import extract and finalize prompts and the no-challenge mode no longer treat an imperative as non-durable, but still refuse one-off tasks and questions and still require a reason.
Distill is collapsed into memory: ingest_files gains a no-store flag that runs the same pipeline (chunk, extract, verify, finalize merge) and returns the merged lines instead of storing; it also accepts text, not only paths.
The old distill chunked and distilled each part in an isolated call and only concatenated the lines, so duplicates across parts survived; the merge pass of import's finalize step 1 is now shared, not rewritten.
With no store, the merge covers the input only, and the call never reads the store.
The UI Distill view and Import as document keep working on the same backend after distill is merged into ingest_files.
The instructions mode is removed; the single prompt keeps rules as short imperatives and facts as claims, with negations, numbers, units, names, paths and template variables verbatim.
An example is never a memory by itself; it stays inside a rule or fact only when the rule is hard to state without it (an exact command, format or error string), fits on one plain-text line with no backticks, and is stated in the source. Longer ones become a pointer to their path.
Doc format kira-memory: 3 has top-level ## Facts and ## Rules sections with the source section as ### under each; fact items stay - <id> <text> with an optional indented reason.
In kira-memory: 3 the Stated in <from>, <heading> locator uses the source heading, never the category.
The kira-memory: 3 format change required updates to the memfmt parser, formatter and validator, writedoc.go, memcheck and the site memory-formats page.
The pipeline has three outputs: stored memories, merged lines (no store), and a .memory.md doc.
The distill MCP tool was removed; ingest_files schema required no longer lists paths, origin or scope, and a no-store call creates no job and emits no kira:memory:changed.
A kira-memory: 2 doc is retired: the memory-check reports the v2 message and exits 1, while a staged v3 doc with both categories exits 0.
A tail chunk under MinTail merges back into the first chunk, so a short second part yields only one chunk.
In the importer tests, unchanged fixture sentences such as "Never call billing-api directly..." are rules too, so the import test asserts the restore rule is stored with kind rule rather than exactly one rule (4 stored rules).
The eval harness reserves 2 USD per phase, so a phase cap of 2 skips every source; the P297 eval subset used KIRA_EVAL_PHASE_CAP_USD=4.
The P297 eval subset showed no R_ess drop (0.899 vs 0.871 baseline mean), so the extract wording stays; precision P was 0.521 vs 0.635, inside baseline noise but under the P289 pass line, and unconfirmed.

### v2.6 P298 Memory: drop operational trivia from distill and import output. Decisions final (user, 2026-10-18). The extract and m... (Done)
The extract and merge prompts (shared by import and distill) must not output facts about how a run was executed: refused or conflicting pushes, branch handling, sandbox or environment limits, flaky test runs or timeouts, fixture or harness gaps noted to explain a skipped check, what was left for the user to verify, or commit mechanics.
Decisions with their reasons, constraints, design choices and their consequences stay in memory output; the trivia exclusion applies to both import and distill, with no exception.
Trivia removal is done through the prompts (memory.merge.system and the extract prompt), not by a filter after the fact.
In the P298 pilot over 10 units, trivia lines fell from 11 to 4 with the reworded prompts. The model still keeps harness and fixture facts as test knowledge even when the Drop list names them. The user accepted this on 2026-10-18, relaxing the trivia pass line from at most 1.
The reworded prompts removed the push, flake, live-check, baseline, real-phone and install trivia lines from output.
A stronger Drop wording risks losing the pathspec guard, which the reworded prompt lost once in the pilot (P131 Part 2) before it came back on rerun.
With the reworded prompts, eval round p298-01 had R_ess 0.903, R_all 0.769, P 0.562 and unsupported 0.000. P is up 0.041 versus p297-01 and 0.008 under the P289 floor of 0.570.
The holdout doc-devenv-claude lost no environment fact under the reworded prompts, with R_ess 0.958 in both rounds.
The P298 change added the prompt memory.runTrivia and grew memory.import.extract.system from 2852 to 4020 chars, memory.merge.system from 2605 to 3824, and memory.import.finalize.system from 3622 to 4841.

### v2.6 P299 Docs history. Decisions final (user, 2026-10-18). Replace every `docs/v*/` chapter except v2.6 (and v2.5 until the ev... (Done)
Decision (final, user, 2026-10-18): every docs/v*/ chapter except v2.6 (and v2.5 until the eval harness is confirmed not to read P285-runs) is replaced by one docs/HISTORY.md; those chapters' SPEC.md and plans/ are deleted.
A script builds HISTORY.md with zero model tokens, because no model reads the old prose.
Per phase, HISTORY.md keeps the P-number, title, status and first sentence of its SPEC row, plus the opening paragraph of the phase's P<n> result section and every line matching decision markers, with a size cap per phase.
Decision markers used to select lines are: decision, decided, user override, declined, rejected, instead of, rather than, supersedes, reverted, renumbered.
Prose outside any P<n> section is scanned with the same decision markers and filed under its chapter.
The planner measures output size and checks a sample of phases against their source, so a decision found only elsewhere in a SPEC is caught.
Code comments and docs pointing at docs/v*/plans/... are repointed at HISTORY.md or lose the reference; git history keeps the deleted files.
P299 folded v1 to v2.2 into docs/HISTORY.md; v2.5 and v2.6 chapters stay.
The history tool waits with backoff on a rate-limit error, charges 0 and does not consume a try.
The tool charges failed claude calls in the spend ledger because cost is not returned on error, so ledgered spend exceeds real spend (sum of costUsd on ok calls).
The generated docs/HISTORY.md has no per-phase line cap; rerunning render gives a clean git diff.
WEBVIEW-SCROLL-MEMORY.md was moved to docs/ when the chapter folders were deleted.
The CLAUDE.md rule passes --runs docs/history-runs; the history tool's default runs dir is the P299 dir.
The repoint command also rewrites the tool's own test fixtures (scripts/docshistory), which must be reverted by hand.
After P299, references to docs/v(1|1.x|2.0-2.2)/ remain only in the tool's own fixtures (scripts/docshistory), docs/pending-changes/ and .github/workflows/.

### v2.6 P300 Docs history, v2.5 and the tool fix. Decisions final (user, 2026-10-18). v2.5 is done and folds into `docs/HISTORY.md... (Done.)
The repoint command in scripts/docshistory must skip its own files (scripts/docshistory/), so a fold does not rewrite the tool's test fixtures.
What the memory eval harness reads at runtime (P285 and P291 corpora, run folders, the promptsizes default path) was moved out of docs/v2.5/plans/ to a non-docs location, keeping the harness green and baselines comparable.
The v2.5 docs were folded into docs/HISTORY.md using the CLAUDE.md rollover command: distill via ingest_files, sequential with --jobs 1, rate-limit backoff, then verify sample, repoint, and git rm of the v2.5 folder except moved data.
docs/WEBVIEW-SCROLL-MEMORY.md was dropped as stale (user decision); its special-case in repoint.go was removed. It stays reachable through git show 7d8a72ab4a5e: pointers in wkhost.swift, ARCHITECTURE.md and PERF.md.
The orchestrator must confirm with the user if the projected phase cost passes 10 USD; the projection uses the P299 mean of 0.068 USD per phase times the v2.5 unit count.
docs/v2.6 stays after the fold (it is not removed).
The verify step failed because verifyBaseTurns was 3: a 2-fact batch hit terminal_reason max_turns in 7 of 8 replays at 3 turns, 0 of 14 at 5 or 6. Batch size was not the cause.
In internal/memory/importer/verify.go the verify base turn count is now 6, scaling with +facts/4 and keeping the cap of 20.
The Claude CLI error error_max_turns maps to memory.ErrClaudeMaxTurns ("Claude Code call hit its turn limit."), which is retryable and passed through memoryErr, instead of the generic "Claude Code failed: exit 1".
In the ledger, failed tries charge a 0.25 USD estimate against the cap while the real cost is recorded as 0.
Under the fix-on-the-spot rule, commit a fix (such as fix(memory)) inside the current phase when a bug is found.
P285-report.md is no longer in the tree and stays reachable via git show b811de651f56:docs/v2.5/plans/P285-report.md; HISTORY.md P285 Part 1 now reads "docs/HISTORY.md (v2.5 P285)" as repoint's output.

### v2.6 P301 Code review (one Opus round, all three dimensions) of code changes only. Decisions final (user, 2026-10-18). Scope: e... (Done.)
The P301 code review is a single Opus round covering all three dimensions, and it reviews code changes only.
P301 review scope is everything changed since the last review session; the reviewer finds the base in git per CLAUDE.md and states it.
P301 review scope excludes all documentation: nothing under docs/, no *.md, no plan, spec, HISTORY.md or pending-changes files.
P301 review scope includes code, tests, scripts, prompts, configs and workflows-as-patches.
In P301 the findings file plans/P301-findings.md must be committed before any fixer starts; then one sequential Sonnet fixer commits per group of related findings.
A review round that finds nothing real must say so.
P301 fixed 7 findings (1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 4.2) and skipped none.
The fix for finding 3.1 ships as the unapplied pending patch docs/pending-changes/.github__workflows__pr.yml.patch, to be applied from an environment with workflow scope.

### v2.6 P302 E2E coverage for the P301 editor fixes. Decisions final (user, 2026-10-18). Two end-to-end tests, each split at the I... (Done)
P302 adds two end-to-end tests for the P301 editor fixes, each split at the IPC boundary per CLAUDE.md: a backend flow test asserts the result and a frontend UI spec asserts the same result.
A workflow YAML or step-editor route that sends back to a manual or skipped step is refused with a parser error, and the editor hides those steps in the route options while keeping the current pick visible.
Removing, moving, changing the kind of, or toggling the smart script of a step clears a stale review.implementer, and the next save succeeds.
The P302 tests reuse the existing adeflow flow-test harness and the ADE UI spec fixtures, with no new mechanism.
The backend already refused a stale implementer; the P301 fix is the editor clearing it, so Go TestWorkflowEditorClearsStaleImplementer passes even without the fix.
Backend refuses a stale review implementer with the error 'implementer must be an earlier agent step'; an empty implementer saves and re-reads as cleared.
Go TestWorkflowReturnToStepThatNeverRuns covers a YAML return to a manual step giving a parser error at line 19, and a graph SaveWorkflow return to a skipped step giving bad-request with the file hash unchanged.
The UI YAML-error test is mock-driven and passes without the fix; the parser guard itself is covered by the Go contract test.
The new Go flow tests write the contract file ade-workflow-editor.json, and shared smart script fixtures live in tests/ui/support/adeV2.ts.

### v2.6 P303 Distill the standing docs: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (600 KB), `docs/PACKAGING.md` (43 KB), `docs/HUMAN_CODE_REVIEW.md`... (Done)
P303 distills the standing docs docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/PACKAGING.md and docs/HUMAN_CODE_REVIEW.md with the P299 pipeline (ingest_files distill on plain text, sequential, P298 prompts), split by section because the input cap is 120,000 characters per call.
P303 touches only docs and the docs tool, so it has zero file overlap with P302 (ADE tests and components); it runs as Stream B in its own git worktree in parallel with P302, by user override of one-phase-at-a-time.
The original text of the distilled docs stays in git and is referenced by git show <commit>:<path> where a pointer needs it.
The P303 plan must keep a pointer scheme so code comments and docs citing ARCHITECTURE.md §n still resolve.
Distill rules keep tables only as one headline figure, and keep ARCHITECTURE's Known open items entry text verbatim.
The P303 ARCHITECTURE.md distill shrank the file from 600,492 to 459,256 bytes (-23.5%), less than the projected 29%, because 2 large units were kept verbatim.
PACKAGING.md ended fully verbatim because the plan's gates failed: the command gate failed in sections 2 and 7, and sections 5 and 8 lost open-state text, so those were kept verbatim.
HUMAN_CODE_REVIEW.md was left unchanged by P303.
Distill verification uses a doc-level loss gate of 45% hard-lost details; ARCHITECTURE held at 24.4% whole-doc loss (1,798 of 7,377).
P303 verification confirmed all 70 Known open items in ARCHITECTURE.md are byte-identical (29,202 bytes) and all E_* error identifiers were kept (35/35).
The docshistory tool counts loss on the unit body only, not the '# file: heading' header; it has a doc show subcommand; render writes the note line only when a unit is distilled and is idempotent.
P303 reference repoint: of 60 lines in 41 files citing ARCHITECTURE.md outside the tool, 50 resolved as-is and 10 were repointed to headings.
The docshistory tool lives in scripts/docshistory and is checked by go test ./scripts/docshistory, go vet ./scripts/... and bun run lint:go.
The P303 verify report is at docs/HISTORY.md (v2.6 P303) and run records are in docs/v2.6/plans/P303-runs/.

### v2.6 P304 Clean up `docs/PERF.md` by hand (no distill pipeline). Decisions final (user, 2026-10-18). Runs as Stream C in its ow... (Done)
docs/PERF.md was cleaned up by hand (no distill pipeline): stale historical result tables of §2 were cut, what is cited or live was kept; size went from 1826 lines / 143,668 B to 1085 / 85,924 B.
In docs/PERF.md, the header, §1 budget table, §2.1a, §2.1c (real-Mac scroll A/B protocol), §2.13, §3 manual procedures and §5 are kept verbatim.
Never renumber or remove a PERF.md section cited from other files, and keep headings unchanged, because docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (owned by P303) cites §1, §2.2, §2.5, §2.6, §2.7, §2.13, §3 and §5.
PERF.md section ids cited and existing after cleanup: §1, 2.1, 2.1a, 2.1c, 2.2, 2.3, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.13, 3, 5.
Point a citation of a removed PERF.md subsection to git show <commit>:docs/PERF.md; if the section is kept, cite the section instead (measure.ts PERF.md:98-102 was repointed to §2.1 methodology note).
PERF.md §1 row 1 reads "p50 ≤ 16 ms and max ≤ 80 ms on the tests/ui/ tier", matching the budgets.spec.ts assertion (p50 <= 16 / max <= 80, P161, recorded in §2.1). It had said 12 ms.
The other PERF.md §1 bounds agree with the specs: 50/300 ms, keystroke 50/200, rAF 80 ms, cells < 1500.
The P163 sentence in PERF.md names the slowest caller: find, 12 MB, 35-51 ms.
The worktree hook needs git-ignored node_modules, site/node_modules, packages/*/node_modules and frontend/bindings symlinked from the main checkout.

### v2.6 P305 Close chapter v2.6. Decisions final (user, 2026-10-18). Runs after P303 and P304 have landed and everything else is d... (Done.)
Phase P305 closes chapter v2.6 by folding phases P294 to P304 (including P305's own row as a closed entry) into docs/HISTORY.md, then deleting the chapter's md files (docs/HISTORY.md (v2.6), docs/v2.6/plans/*.md and docs/history-runs/).
P305 runs only after P303 and P304 have landed and everything else is done.
The chapter fold uses the CLAUDE.md rollover command: go run ./scripts/docshistory fold --runs docs/history-runs --out - --jobs 1 --max-usd <cap> v2.6, which is sequential, backs off on rate limits and is resume-safe.
The P305 verify pass requires every phase row P294 to P304 to be present in HISTORY.md with its decisions and cost.
The P305 planner must decide which non-md data under docs/HISTORY.md (v2.6) is read at runtime or in tests (P298-pilot, P299-pilot, P299-runs, P303-pilot, runs ledgers), and either move it to a testdata home or delete it with the folder.
References to v2.6 plans and docs/v2.6 in code comments, docs, tests and CLAUDE.md are repointed to a HISTORY.md entry or to git show <commit>:path.
Once the chapter folder is gone, the next phase number is found by the HISTORY.md highest-P rule.
In the docshistory tool, the v2.6 guard was removed from checkChapter, and a planResultChapter rule (v2.0, v2.5 and later) replaces the map.
The docshistory doc command's default --runs is docs/history-runs.
CLAUDE.md's highest-P rule now reads only the open chapter's SPEC.md, the start list gains v2.5 and v2.6, and the rollover rule now reads "Closing a chapter folds it".
The P299 and P300 plan bodies were restored (283 and 227 lines), and units v2.6 shows 12 phases, 47,160 bytes, and no notes unit.

<!-- chapter v2.8 -->
## v2.8
Source: docs/v2.8/ at 1f51d154fc5f. 17 phases.

### v2.8 P306 (Done)
Pushing changes under .github/workflows is not possible from the agent environment; docs/DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md describes this.
The ci-gate job fails whenever PR CI fails.

### v2.8 P307 Part 1 (Done)
The operations panel shows a database's preconnect scripts.
A preconnect script run has a visible timer.
A race between "connecting" and the preconnect script itself was fixed.

### v2.8 P307 Part 2 (Done)
P307 Part 2 adds a per-connection preconnect delay setting, in seconds, between starting the preconnect script and the first connect attempt. It covers non-loopback targets that the Part 1 readiness probe skips.
P307 Part 2 must run after P312 lands, because the migration number and generated bindings overlap.

### v2.8 P308 (Done)
v2.8 P308 (Done) lets users reorder databases, scripts and repos in the left panel by drag-and-drop.
v2.8 P308 made the colored bars in the left panel thicker.

### v2.8 P309 (Done)
In the SQL cell editor, the footer controls stay fixed and only the text editor scrolls, because the editor's large minimum height previously scrolled it out of view.

### v2.8 P310 (Done)
The SQL column tooltip stacks its sections: header with name and type, `PK`/`NOT NULL` chips, explanation, divider, labeled comment.
`AttributeTooltip.vue` gains `tags` and `note` parts; the plain `data-kira-tip` path stays unchanged.
Lint rules U29 and U21 forbid classes on `TooltipContent` and `uppercase`, so the layout sits on a wrapper div and the width cap stays at the primitive `max-w-xs`.
The UI spec `tooltips.spec.ts` covers the structure.

### v2.8 P311 (Done)
The Docker container list scrolled sluggishly because virtual rows were re-created on every range change and each row paid for its own tooltip and nav handler.
`VirtualList.vue` keys rows by row key and caches handlers; rows split into `ContainerRow.vue` and `ContainerGroupRow.vue` that share one `AttributeTooltip`.
The `docker-scroll` probe (400 containers) cut frame p95 median from 40-46 ms to 20 ms, a 50-57% drop.
The spec `row tooltips come from one shared tooltip` guards the shared tooltip.

### v2.8 P312 (Done)
Panel sizes are stored per module, not shared across modules; the change applies in studio and the api stays unchanged.
Panel size storage is re-keyed per module, and the current shared values are migrated.

### v2.8 P313 (Done)
One code review round over `a74ece9..e05b483` (base: the v2.6 squash, P305 close-out) found 4 issues, all fixed.
A duplicate-connection INSERT had misaligned placeholders that put the throttle into `mcp_enabled` (High); a test guards it.
The dialog Test preconnect script survived app quit; `Shutdown` now cancels it and waits.
A preconnect script cancelled from the panel now ends `disconnected`.
`widthUserSet` was persisted in both layout models; it is no longer.
The performance pass found nothing.
Raw English supervisor messages in the dialog Test result remain unlocalized, out of scope.

### v2.8 P314 (Done)
Users pick the Claude model for memory features (distill, import, summaries) in settings; sonnet is the default.
The memory model setting replaces the hardcoded claudeModel in internal/memory/claude.go.

### v2.8 P315 (Done)
v2.8 P315 adds a short-text distill mode: distill of small pasted or in-memory text (such as a code comment, not a file read from disk) uses its own single-call rewrite path instead of extract, verify, merge.
The extract, verify, merge path loses form and drops content on short text, so short-text distill has a separate path.
Short-text distill must keep every non-obvious fact, drop trivia, and keep the input's form.
In P315 an Opus plan decided the prompt, gates and API shape of short-text distill.
Round 3 of the P315 pilot passed under the round-3 bars (meaning-level bad 1, missed-trivia 9, harmful re-pass changes 0, cosmetic churn 1.1%) with idempotence 94.6%, one unit short of the literal 95% plan bar.
Round 5 of the P315 pilot passed all bars: meaning-level bad 2 of 120, missed-trivia 4, harmful second-pass changes 0, second-pass churn 3.0%, arm B meaning-level bad 0.

### v2.8 P316 (Done)
Claude is the only supported agent harness and stays the only implementation after the v2.8 P316 agent harness abstraction.
v2.8 P316 introduces provider-neutral interfaces (runner, model list, availability, MCP/tool wiring, cost reporting) so another harness or agent can be added without touching callers.
The v2.8 P316 harness abstraction covers memory, smart scripts and any other Claude call site, and must make no behavior change.

### v2.8 P317 (Done)
In rewrite mode the pre-check needsRewrite was removed, so the model reads every text.
The optional check call was removed across MCP, bridge, UI, tests and docs: the check parameter, memory.rewrite.check.system and the check gate.
The rewrite pilot bars are: meaning-level bad <=3/120, missed trivia <=12/120, zero harmful second-pass changes, and second-pass churn <=5%.
Pilot rounds use 120 repo comments plus 50 third-party units and notes, with a first and second pass, judged by Opus.
Second-pass churn in round 6 (7.8%) is not comparable with round 5 (3.0%), because the round-5 pre-check skipped 67 of 99 re-fed texts and hid the model's instability.
Without the pre-check, second-pass churn exceeded the 5% bar in rounds 6 (7.8%), 7 (7.0%) and 8 (8.8%), and passed in round 9 (3.1%, 3/97).
In round 9 every arm A bar passed (0 meaning-level bad, 5 missed trivia, 0 harmful second-pass changes), but arm B failed with 1 meaning-level bad (#37).
The round-9 arm B failure is an @author line dropped from third-party code; if the owner classes authorship as droppable history, every bar passes.

### v2.8 P318 (Done)
GitHub is the only supported git host. P318 (v2.8, Done) introduces provider-neutral interfaces behind a registry and a provider setting so another host such as GitLab can be added without touching callers.
The git host interfaces cover auth and account, repository and remote identity, pull/merge requests, reviews and comments, CI status, URL building, and the API client.
GitHub remains the only git host implementation after P318, and its behavior is unchanged.
P318 adds no back-compat shims; data loss is acceptable.
The P318 key test registers a fake second git host through a test option and runs the same flows with it without any caller changes.

### v2.8 P319 (Done)
Phase P319 (v2.8) is a code review of everything changed since the last review session, including P314-P318, run in two rounds.
Each P319 review round has an Opus reviewer covering architecture, correctness and performance, followed by a Sonnet fixer.
Round 2 of the P319 review covers the full diff since the same base, including the round-1 fixes.
P319 code review runs last, right before the comment sweep.

### v2.8 P320 (Done)
The v2.8 P320 comment cleanup covers Go, TS and Vue code and rewrites comments via the distill plumbing into shorter atomic comments in one consistent format, per the CLAUDE.md comment rule.
When rewriting comments, drop trivia and comments that restate code, keep every non-obvious why, constraint or workaround, and never touch directives.
The comment rewrite needs a quality gate of rule-based checks plus a sampled before/after report reviewed by an Opus judge; failures are redone.
An Opus plan decides the comment format and the quality gate for the cleanup.
The comment cleanup requires building a comment-extraction tool.

### v2.8 P321 (Done)
<!-- /chapter v2.8 -->
