// *application.StreamConn satisfies it structurally — Send([]byte) error (stream.go:234) and
// Receive() ([]byte, error) (stream.go:274) — so this package still imports no Wails (P56 D1). The
// same method set as adapterhost.StreamSession (A11's per-consumer-interface discipline); passing
// a bridge.StreamSession value where adapterhost.StreamSession is expected works because Go
// matches interfaces structurally even across two independently-declared types.

// StreamName is the one named stream (P52 §7.2). The renderer's replacement for
// src/renderer/bridge/port.ts opens it once per page load; Wails supersedes an older generation's
// session automatically (stream.go:747-800), which is what retires index.ts's own `generation`
// counter.

// ServeEngineStream runs for the life of one connection and returns when the renderer's side
// closes (page reload, window close, app shutdown). After P58a M4 this is a data-plane server, not
// a byte forwarder (P58 D3): router.AttachStream gives this session its own single writer (A18),
// and every inbound frame is handed to router.HandleDataFrameAsync, which decides — per connection
// kind — whether to answer it in-process or forward it to the Node engine child unchanged.
// HandleDataFrameAsync runs the frame on its own goroutine so a slow read never serialises behind
// it, bounded to a fixed number of concurrent ops per session (P2 R1: a burst of frames used to
// spawn goroutines without limit); responses are correlated by id, so out-of-order completion is
// already the renderer's own contract (port.ts's pending map).
