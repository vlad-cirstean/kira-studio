// AllowPublicKeyRetrieval-style gate at all — it requests the server's RSA public key over
// plaintext unconditionally whenever caching_sha2_password needs it, so this option would be a
// no-op that reads like a real control. Recorded as a capability loss in
// docs/ARCHITECTURE.md's per-engine section and AGENTS.md's P58b findings, not silently dropped.
