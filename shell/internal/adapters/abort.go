import "context"

// RunWithAbortRace is abort.ts's withAbortRace: issue runs the real driver call on a context
// detached from ctx's own cancellation, on its own goroutine, while this function returns to the
// caller as soon as either the query settles or ctx is done — whichever first. A local
// cancellation (adapterhost.Host.CancelOp's own ctx.cancel(), the first of its two steps) must
// unblock the caller immediately without itself touching the still-running server-side work
// (query.ts:77-80's "do not fix it by trying to make the query itself abort"): every context-native
// Go driver this package's adapters use (pgx, go-sql-driver/mysql, an HTTP request's own ctx,
// modernc.org/sqlite) honours ctx natively and would otherwise race its own cancellation against —
// and often win before — the adapter's own explicit server-side kill, the one place a real
// cancellation is meant to happen (P58a's own AGENTS.md findings: pgx first, generalised here for
// mysql-family/clickhouse/sqlite in P58b — three more reasons, one helper, §1.7 of
// docs/v1/plans/P58b-mysql-sqlite-clickhouse.md).
//
// release is called exactly once, whenever issue actually settles — not merely when ctx fires — so
// a caller's own Cancel(opID) still finds whatever it tracks (a backend pid, a thread id, a
// query_id) if it runs shortly after a local abort. sqlite's own adapter uses this same helper with
// the opposite polarity (B8): there, the *op's* context must never reach the driver at all, since
// modernc.org/sqlite's own sqlite3_interrupt firing on ctx.Done() is the only cancellation
// mechanism sqlite has — an adapter-owned cancellable context takes the op's place, and
// RunWithAbortRace races the caller's own ctx.Done() against that context's completion the same
// way it races a network driver's.
