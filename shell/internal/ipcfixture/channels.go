// Package ipcfixture is the Go successor to tests/ipc/'s TypeScript fixture generator (P58f D13).
// It drives the real app stack — storage, repos, connections.Service, tree.Service, the bridge
// services, and a real adapterhost.Router/Dispatcher — against a real adapter container, and
// either asserts the result against a committed fixture (the default) or writes a fresh one
// (KIRA_IPC_FIXTURES=write, D15). Six per-adapter *_test.go files share the machinery in this
// file plus decode.go, write.go and frozen.go.
package ipcfixture

// The six IPC channels every committed fixture needs (P58f §4.3(a)) — grepped verbatim from
// src/shared/protocol/ipc.ts's IPC map, never inferred from the TypeScript identifier (AGENTS.md's
// P52-P56 finding: ENGINE_OP.configureCache is 'cache:configure', not 'engine:configure-cache').
