# setup.sh — the one entry point for everything a fresh clone (or a dev/package loop) needs before
# building: the Bun workspace, the Go module, the pinned `wails3` CLI, and — only when the CLI or
# toolchain identity has actually changed — a bindings regeneration. Wired as `predev`/`prepackage`.

# Absorbs install-deps.sh + wails-dev-setup.sh (P20 D6): the two were always invoked as a pair
# (this file's own callers; README.md's script table already described them as one step) and
# duplicated the ROOT_DIR idiom, a `command -v` preflight and the GOPATH/bin bootstrap between
# them. P58f: there is no vendored Node runtime or bundled engine to check for any more — every
# adapter is served in-process by native Go.

# Bindings regeneration is delegated to the task itself (P3 D11's preferred branch, P20 D8) —
# `common:generate:bindings` has a correct content checksum (P20 D3) over its own Go/TS sources
# (confirmed directly: touching a Go source file this task reads flips it from "up to date" to a
# real ~7s regen; reverting it drops back to a ~0.2s no-op run), so it's called unconditionally
# below, every setup.sh run. It's the sources it can't see that need a stamp: the wails3 CLI's own
# identity, and whether its build toolchain matches go.mod's directive (P20 F5/F6/F7). Task's
# per-task checksum cache survives a CLI reinstall, so on its own a "same sources, new/reinstalled
# CLI" run reports "up to date" and skips regenerating even though a different generator binary can
# produce different output for identical input — the stale-toolchain bug P20 F5/F6/F7 names. Wiping
# Task's cache on an identity change forces the unconditional call below to do a real regen instead
# of trusting a checksum computed under the old binary.
