# P110 B5: guards every legacy/retired class name this CSS-to-Tailwind migration renames or
# deletes from ever coming back. Each check greps for one retired name, anchored the same way
# check-tokens.sh anchors --kira-* references: the name must be preceded by whitespace, a quote,
# a backtick, a brace or a colon (i.e. a real class-name token, possibly with a variant chain like
# `hover:`), and not immediately followed by another identifier character or hyphen -- so
# `text-muted` never matches `text-muted-foreground`, and `bg-input` never matches a
# `--kira-bg-input` custom-property reference.
#
# Excludes packages/theme/src/components/ui/ -- shadcn-vue's own registry-authored components
# speak shadcn's own vocabulary (bg-input/30, text-muted-foreground, border-input, ...), which is
# never a "retired name" hit here even where a retired name is a substring of it.
#
# Every commit that retires a class name appends its own `check_class` call here, in the same
# commit that does the rename/deletion (P110 plan §5.12). Never a batch add at the end.
