# pull-test-images.sh — pulls every Testcontainers image through mirror.gcr.io in parallel and

# Flow-test images (alpine, bash) keep their mirror name only: a second plain tag on the same image
# changes which tag the Docker registry-link logic picks and fails dockerflow TestImageRegistryURL.
# A failed pull is reported, never fatal: testcontainers pulls that image itself at test time.
