# sign-bundle.sh — P52 §10.1's four codesign lines, made real (P57 §4.13). P58f: there is no
# vendored node binary and no Kafka native module to sign individually any more — every adapter,
# Kafka included, is served in-process by native Go since P58e/P58f. One deep sign over the whole
# bundle is all that is left.
#
# Paths are apps/kira-studio/build/darwin/Taskfile.yml's create:app:bundle output layout, not P52's — that
# plan explicitly warned its own paths were written from an earlier session and would need
# re-verifying against a real packaged bundle rather than copied. macOS only.

# .app *inside* it is already signed — `create:app:bundle` runs `codesign:adhoc` before
# `create:dmg` copies the bundle in — and re-signing the outer .app above cannot reach that copy,
# which is why the order matters and why this signs the image rather than rebuilding it. A disk
# image is a flat file: `--deep` has nothing to recurse into, so it is deliberately absent here.
