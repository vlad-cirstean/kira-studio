# Kira Studio — local database fixtures

Spins up ten of Kira Studio's eleven supported engines (PostgreSQL, MariaDB, MySQL, ClickHouse,
RabbitMQ, MongoDB, Redis, Kafka, SQS, S3) via [Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima) + Docker
Compose. The six relational/document/key-value stores get a full schema, foreign keys or their
MergeTree equivalent, indexes, and ~20k rows of seed data; Kafka/SQS/S3/RabbitMQ get a handful of
topics/queues/buckets/exchanges with a small backlog — enough to exercise every tree view without
waiting on a multi-minute seed.

The eleventh engine, SQLite, needs no container at all (P35 D36) — the artefact a SQLite connection
needs is a file on disk, so `sqlite/seed.ts` builds one directly with `bun`, using the same
`node:sqlite` module the app's own adapter reads it with. See its own section below.

Kafka uses the same image/mode as the `@testcontainers/kafka` harness under `bun run test:db`
(confluentinc/cp-kafka in KRaft mode) — see `tests/db/support/kafka.ts`. SQS and S3 share one
LocalStack container (`SERVICES=sqs,s3`), same as `@testcontainers/localstack`'s own harnesses —
see `tests/db/support/sqs.ts` and `tests/db/support/s3.ts`.

## Requirements

- [Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima) running with the Docker runtime
- `docker` and `docker-compose` on the PATH
- For SQLite only: a `bun` with `node:sqlite` (1.4+), or Electron/Node 22.5+ — no Docker needed

## Start the databases

```sh
docker-compose -f scripts/demo-dbs/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Wait for all containers to report healthy:

```sh
docker ps
```

## Seed the data

```sh
bash scripts/demo-dbs/seed.sh
```

The schema is applied automatically on first container start (via
`/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`). The seed step is separate and can be re-run any
time to reset data — safe to re-run for the four relational/document/key-value stores; for Kafka,
SQS and RabbitMQ it appends another batch of messages rather than resetting (see the Model section
below).
`seed.sh`'s SQLite step needs no `up -d` first — it deletes and rebuilds
`sqlite/kira-demo.sqlite` directly, so it's safe to re-run on its own too:
`bun scripts/demo-dbs/sqlite/seed.ts`.

## Connections

| Database | Host | Port | User     | Password | DB   |
|----------|------|------|----------|----------|------|
| PostgreSQL | localhost | 5432 | `kira` | `kira` | `kira` |
| MariaDB  | localhost | 3306 | `kira` | `kira` | `kira` |
| MySQL    | localhost | 3307 | `kira` | `kira` | `kira` |
| ClickHouse | localhost | 8124 | `kira` | `kira` | `kira` |
| RabbitMQ | localhost | 15672 | `kira` | `kira` | `kira` |
| MongoDB  | localhost | 27017 | — (no auth) | — | `kira` |
| Redis    | localhost | 6379 | — | — | db 0 |
| Kafka    | localhost | 9092 | — | — | — |
| SQS (LocalStack) | — (URI mode) | — | `test` | `test` | region `us-east-1` |
| S3 (LocalStack)  | — (URI mode) | — | `test` | `test` | region `us-east-1` |
| SQLite   | — (no network) | — | — | — | `scripts/demo-dbs/sqlite/kira-demo.sqlite` |

Connection strings:

```sh
postgresql://kira:kira@localhost:5432/kira
mariadb://kira:kira@localhost:3306/kira
mysql://kira:kira@localhost:3307/kira
clickhouse://kira:kira@localhost:8124/kira
rabbitmq://kira:kira@localhost:15672/kira
mongodb://localhost:27017/kira
redis://localhost:6379/0
```

Kafka has no auth — in Kira Studio's connection dialog, Fields mode with host `localhost` and port
`9092` is enough.

SQS and S3 both always need a real region plus an endpoint override to redirect the AWS SDK at
LocalStack instead of real AWS, so they only work in URI mode (`options.endpoint`, set via the
URI's query string — see `src/shared/domain/uri.ts`):

```sh
sqs://test:test@us-east-1?endpoint=http://localhost:4566
s3://test:test@us-east-1?endpoint=http://localhost:4566
```

SQLite has no network fields at all — in the connection dialog, Fields mode's **Database file**
field takes the absolute path printed by `sqlite/seed.ts` (or **Browse…** to it):

```
scripts/demo-dbs/sqlite/kira-demo.sqlite
```

## Model

Every relational database uses the same e-commerce-shaped model:

- `customers` (20k)
- `customer_addresses` (20k) → FK `customers`
- `categories` (20k) → self-referencing FK
- `products` (20k) → FK `categories`
- `orders` (20k) → FK `customers`, `customer_addresses`
- `order_items` (80k) → FK `orders`, `products`
- `reviews` (20k) → FK `products`, `customers`
- `data_types_demo` (1) — one row exercising every column type

ClickHouse gets the same e-commerce model, re-expressed in MergeTree terms (P36 D38) — `customers`
(20k), `customer_addresses` (20k), `categories` (20k, self-referencing), `products` (20k), `orders`
(20k), `order_items` (80k, plus a real CHECK constraint), `reviews` (20k), an `order_summary` view
and `order_summary_mv` materialized view (so the tree's Views/Materialized views folders both have
something here too), and a `data_types_demo` (1) row showing ClickHouse's own type family
(Array/Tuple/Map/Enum8/UUID/IPv4/IPv6/Decimal/DateTime64/FixedString/LowCardinality/the geo types)
rather than a literal port of the others' MySQL-shaped columns — the same call SQLite's own seed
already makes for its own engine's types. No PRIMARY KEY/FOREIGN KEY/UNIQUE/AUTO_INCREMENT
anywhere: ClickHouse has none of them (F16/F17), so every id is a hand-assigned value and every
`ORDER BY` is the MergeTree analog, not a uniqueness guarantee — the same reason the app's own
− row button stays disabled for this connection.

RabbitMQ gets its own small message-broker topology rather than a row-shaped port of the others
(P37 D40): a `kira` virtual host holding three exchanges (`orders.direct`, `events.fanout`,
`events.topic`, the last two bound to each other so the tree's exchange definition view has a real
exchange-to-exchange binding to show on both sides), an `orders` queue (40 messages, an
`orders-ttl` policy), a `notifications` queue (20 messages, fanned out from `events.fanout`), an
`empty-queue`, and a `large-queue` (2,000 messages — enough to demonstrate the app's own 500-message
poll clamp without a multi-minute seed, since RabbitMQ's management API publishes one message per
HTTP request with no bulk path the way Kafka's console producer has). The seed runs on the host,
not via `docker exec` — the `-management` image ships no bulk-publish CLI worth exec'ing into, so
`rabbitmq/seed.sh` talks to `localhost:15672` directly with `curl`, the same HTTP surface the app's
own adapter reads. The same reason the app's own − row button stays disabled here too: a RabbitMQ
message has no broker-assigned identity, so there is no addressable row to delete.

MongoDB mirrors this with the same collections (`customers`, `addresses`,
`categories`, `products`, `orders`, `orderItems`, `reviews`) using `ObjectId`
references and the same index set (unique, single-field, compound, text,
geospatial).

Redis has no schema; the seed creates 25k keys of each core data type: hashes
(`user:<id>`), strings (`session:<id>`), a sorted set (`leaderboard`), a set
(`active:users`), a list (`recent:events`), and a stream (`events`), plus TTLs.

Kafka gets three topics: `orders` (2 partitions, 15 keyed JSON messages, `{seq}` payloads),
`empty-topic` (0 messages, to exercise an empty topic in the tree), and `large-topic` (4
partitions, 20k keyed JSON messages — the same scale as the relational seeds' `orders` table, to
exercise pagination/large-message-count rendering). A `kira-demo-group` consumer group is
registered by draining `orders` once during seeding, so the consumer-groups view isn't empty
either.

SQS gets three queues: `orders-queue` (15 messages), `drain-queue` (15 messages, a second queue so
polling one doesn't race the other's `VisibilityTimeout`), and `empty-queue` (0 messages).

S3 gets three buckets. `kira-demo-bucket` carries the full P33 (download/upload/delete/bounded
edit) demo surface: `readme.txt` (root-level, `Metadata.seeded=true`), `reports/notes.txt` and
`reports/2024/summary.json` (nesting depth), `reports/quarter one (Q1).json` (a key with spaces
and parentheses, to exercise path encoding through download/delete/the tab title); a
`sizes/` ladder — `tiny.txt` (0 bytes), `small.json` (~4 KB, ordinary edit case), `medium.csv`
(~512 KB, editable but large enough to feel it), `large.log` (~2 MB — renders, but Edit is
disabled since it's over `OBJECT_BODY_EDIT_BYTES`), `huge.bin` (~8 MB — over
`OBJECT_BODY_PREVIEW_BYTES`, no Body row at all, Download is the only way to see it), `logo.png`
(a real tiny PNG — previews lossily, Edit refused as not valid UTF-8); and `bulk/` with 1,200
small JSON objects, past `ListObjectsV2`'s 1,000-key page, to exercise the tree's continuation
loop. `kira-uploads-bucket` is empty — the upload target, and the case of a bucket with nothing
in it to open an object from (Upload has to be reachable from the bucket row itself).
`kira-empty-bucket` stays empty too, unrelated to uploads.

SQLite gets the same e-commerce model as the four relational engines above — `customers` (20k),
`customer_addresses` (20k), `categories` (20k, self-referencing), `products` (20k), `orders`
(20k), `order_items` (80k), `reviews` (20k), and a one-row `data_types_demo` — built with plain JS
loops rather than a `WITH RECURSIVE` numbers CTE (there's no client round trip to save, so a loop
reads the same either way). `data_types_demo` shows SQLite's own type vocabulary rather than a
literal port of the others' columns: no ENUM/SET/BIT/YEAR/geometry types exist to stand in for, so
it instead demonstrates the five affinity families side by side, plus a column with no declared
type at all (F21 — the one case `typeClassFor` reports as `other`).

Unlike the relational/document seeds, the Kafka/SQS/S3/RabbitMQ seeds are **not** idempotent in the
same way — topics/queues/exchanges/bindings are created idempotently (`--if-not-exists`, reused, or
a plain `PUT` for RabbitMQ's own declare-is-idempotent semantics) and S3 objects are simply
overwritten in place, but re-running `seed.sh` appends another batch of messages to Kafka/SQS/
RabbitMQ on top of whatever's already there (a topic/queue has no primary key to upsert against).
Use `down -v` + `up -d` + `seed.sh` for a clean slate.
