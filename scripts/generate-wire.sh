# generate-wire.sh — regenerates the FlatBuffers data-plane wire code (P11) from
# packages/shared/protocol/wire.fbs. Fetches a pinned flatc into a gitignored .tools/ cache
# (verified by SHA-256) rather than assuming one is on PATH, the same reasoning setup.sh applies to
# wails3: an unpinned compiler is exactly how generated code drifts from what's
# committed. Run via `bun run generate:wire` whenever wire.fbs changes; the generated output is
# committed to the repo (P11 D11), so this script's job is to reproduce it byte-for-byte, not to
# run automatically on every build.
