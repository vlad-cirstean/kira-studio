// WindowRecord is one row of the `windows` table's identity/geometry columns (P8 D2/D4) — a

// or resized at least once (D10: a freshly minted window with no stored rectangle inherits its
// cascade position instead).
//
// This app's own `windows` table gained a `mode` column at P128 §2.2 (migration
// 0003_p128_window_mode.sql, the git/automations/ade module registry) — read and written through
// WindowsRepo.GetMode/SetMode below, not through this struct, so WindowRecord itself stays
// field-for-field identical to appstorage.WindowRecord and a plain alias of it (P107 I2-3),
// Validate() included; internal/shell/window.go's own Options()/Attach() never read a mode, only
// .Key/.Bounds.
type WindowRecord = appstorage.WindowRecord

// WindowModes is this app's own mode vocabulary (workbench/modes.ts's SpaceMode) — an unrecognised
// or since-removed mode degrades to Default via appstorage.WindowModes.Normalize rather than
// failing to read/write the row.
