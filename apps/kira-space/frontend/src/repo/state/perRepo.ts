import { reactive } from 'vue';

/**
 * "One entry per open repo workspace", get-or-create, the same reactive-`Map` pattern
 * `search.ts`/`fileTree.ts`/`worktrees.ts` each implemented on their own: the Map itself is
 * wrapped in `reactive()`, not just each value, so a computed/template that reads `stateFor(id)`
 * (or `all.get(id)`) before an entry exists still reruns once one is later created — a plain Map
 * makes that first `.get()` untracked (Vue 3's native Map/Set reactivity needs the Map itself to
 * be the reactive object).
 *
 * Not a Pinia store itself — CLAUDE.md's "one store, one concern" still holds. Each of the three
 * stores above composes this helper for its own per-repo state shape rather than sharing one
 * grab-bag store, and keeps its own `drop*`/`collapse*` wrapper where dropping an entry needs
 * more than the Map deletion (`search.ts`'s own `repoBySearchId` cleanup, `worktrees.ts`'s own
 * `release`).
