// Scope is the kind of secret a ciphertext was sealed for. It is AES-GCM's additional
// authenticated data (P29), which is what makes a ciphertext refuse to decrypt anywhere but the
// kind of column it was written for — P21 round 2 architecture/security finding 10.
//
// These strings are a storage format, not a label: changing one orphans every secret already
// stored under it, exactly the way changing envelopePrefix does. cipher_test.go freezes them.
