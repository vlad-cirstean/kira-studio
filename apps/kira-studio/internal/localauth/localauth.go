// Package localauth is P14's reveal gate: the app's own front door to the operating system's
// device-owner authentication (macOS's LocalAuthentication.framework, Touch ID with a
// system-password fallback), used by internal/connections.Service.Reveal to confirm a person
// before a saved credential is decrypted for display.
//
// Every decision this package makes lives in this file, which carries no build tag, so a plain
// `go test` on Linux genuinely exercises the whole gate (P7 §1.4's rule, mirrored from
// internal/secrets/cipher.go's probe). evaluate_darwin.go and evaluate_other.go are mechanical,
// logic-free platform shims that only answer two questions this file asks them: can OS auth run
// at all right now, and — if so — did it just succeed.

// needs to name, and a genuine evaluate failure is reported through Authorize's returned error
