// decides, from one poll round's own observations, whether a partition's remaining [Next, End) gap
// is provably nothing but non-data offsets. This is the one function in the package reachable
// without a broker, and its history includes a real regression (hasMore stuck true forever), so it
// gets the phase's one dedicated Go unit test rather than relying on the acceptance suite's single
// transactional-gap scenario alone.
