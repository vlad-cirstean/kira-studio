// "//abs/path", one leading slash short of the real path, exactly like JS's url.pathname does.

// path containing either character silently truncates the filename and lets the remainder be read
// as query parameters, which is exactly where `mode=ro`/`_query_only=1` (this adapter's entire
// read-only enforcement) live. A `database` value of `/data/x.db?mode=rwc&_query_only=0` would
// defeat the read-only toggle quietly, with the UI still showing the connection as read-only, and
// assertFileExists (which stats the real, un-truncated path) would not catch it either. Rejecting
