// in-flight op — while the set's own mu was still held, so opening one more entry while a long op
// ran on the LRU victim blocked *every* other entry (including a bare map lookup for the already-open
// primary) behind that op. detachLocked below only touches the map/lru under mu; the actual Close
// happens after mu is released. (b) dialing itself used to run with no lock held at all, so two
// concurrent Get calls for the same not-yet-open key both dialed, the second overwriting the first
// in conns — a leaked entry (and whatever live server-side resource it held) for the life of the
// app. The dialing map turns this into a single-flight: the first caller for a key dials while
// holding a placeholder; everyone else waits on that placeholder's own outcome instead.
