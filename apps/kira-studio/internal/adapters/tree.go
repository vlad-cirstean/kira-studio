// This file hoists the two path-depth error shapes postgres/mysqlfamily/sqlite's own Children each
// spelled out verbatim (P107 I2-11). The depth-by-depth dispatch itself — segment-Kind checks
// interleaved with per-level listing calls — stays in each adapter: postgres acquires its
// per-database *pgx.Conn once and reuses it through both its schema and relation listing (a depth
// mysqlfamily/sqlite have no equivalent of), while sqlite wraps the whole call in runOnConn rather
// than an explicit acquire/release pair. Folding that dispatch into one shared walker would have to
// either invent a connection-acquisition step none of the three actually share, or silently add or
// drop the "acquire a connection even for a leaf path" side effect each adapter's own dispatch order
// currently gives it — a real behavioral risk for no length win, so it was declined.

// UnexpectedPathKind is Children's own "this segment's Kind doesn't match what this depth expects"

// says "root path segment kind"; every deeper depth says "path segment kind at depth N".
