// generationTracker tracks a monotonically increasing generation per (connectionID, path) target,
// one per connection, and one global — F4 (P108 Part 6). Guarded by Cache.mu, not a lock of its
// own: every method here is only ever called from a Cache method that already holds it.
//
// Read/Count store their results unconditionally once the underlying op returns, with nothing
// guarding against InvalidateAfterMutation, DropTarget, DropConnection (including mid-reconnect)
// or Clear having run while that op was still in flight — a cache miss that races one of those
// could still complete and cache its own now-stale, pre-invalidation result as if it were fresh
// (Source: "cache" on the next read). Cache.CurrentGeneration captures a snapshot right after the
// miss decision, before the underlying op is even issued; StorePageIfCurrent/StoreCountIfCurrent
// only actually store the result if nothing has bumped the generation by the time it returns.
