// never line up with newlines — a single line can arrive split across several reads, or several
// lines can arrive in one. carry holds only the unterminated remainder after the last newline
// seen so far; without tracking that separately from last, a line already completed by a
// previous chunk's trailing newline would get silently reused as a prefix for the next chunk's
// content instead of being replaced by it. The zero value is ready to use.

// P21 round 2 performance finding 5: for a sidecar whose stderr carries no newline at all for a
// long stretch — a progress bar rewriting its line with a bare '\r' (curl, rsync, docker pull, and
// many cloud-proxy CLIs all do this), or any tool that streams without newlines — push used to
// grow carry without any cap: stderrTailMax was applied only in value(), at read time, bounding
// nothing that was actually *retained*. A sidecar lives as long as its connection, so carry could
// grow for the process's entire runtime, and each push cost O(len(carry)) for `t.carry + chunk`
// plus ReplaceAll/Split — O(n^2) in total stderr volume.
//
// Two independent fixes, both below: capCarry keeps only the first stderrTailMax bytes of carry
// after every push. That is safe because value() can never return more than the first
// stderrTailMax bytes of whatever `last` eventually becomes (t.last[:stderrTailMax]) — once carry
// exceeds that length, every byte past it is already unobservable, so discarding them changes
// nothing value() could ever report while keeping carry's own size bounded by a constant instead
// of by cumulative input. And a chunk with no '\r' or '\n' in it at all — the common case for a
// bare-\r progress bar — takes an early, cheap path that skips splitLines' own ReplaceAll/Split
// entirely, since there is no line boundary to find.
