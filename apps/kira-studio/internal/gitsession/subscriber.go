// subscriber is D14's coalescing per-connection delivery: the watcher goroutine's note() never
// blocks and never allocates per event — it ORs a flag under a small mutex and does a
// non-blocking wake — and one dedicated goroutine per subscriber turns that into at most one
// deliver call per signal kind, however many events arrived in between. This is what SPEC §6 means
// by "fanned out ... over its own coalescing buffered channel so one slow client can't stall the
// watcher for others": coalescing lives in the flags, not in a channel of events, so a burst never
// queues N deliveries and a client stuck for a second only ever gets one repo.changed once it's
// unstuck.
