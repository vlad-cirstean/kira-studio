// Package startupfail is the whole of G29's logic: showing the user a native alert, and getting a
// log record written, for any of the boot-sequence failures apps/kira-studio/main.go hits before
// any window (and, for five of the nine sites, before any *application.App at all) exists.
//
// Why this package exists rather than reaching for what is already in the tree: Wails v3's own
// dialog API is a nil-pointer dereference at every one of these sites — MessageDialog.Show's
// InvokeSync (pkg/application/dialogs.go) dispatches through globalApplication.dispatchOnMainThread
// (pkg/application/mainthread.go), and globalApplication is nil until application.New returns
// (assigned inside New, pkg/application/application.go), while a.impl — also dereferenced along
// that path — is assigned only inside Run(). Every boot-failure site in main.go runs before one or
// both of those exist (G29 plan F4). So the mechanism here is a plain os/exec spawn of macOS's own
// /usr/bin/osascript (D3), the same argv-only, no-shell discipline internal/gitvsix already uses
// for `code`/`open`: title and body always travel as argv items, never interpolated into any
// AppleScript source string (D4) — the error text this package renders can be anything an
// underlying library chose to put in an error, including quotes, backslashes and newlines, and none
// of it is trusted to be safe inside a script.
//
// Pure Go, no cgo: the whole point of (a) over a cgo NSAlert/CFUserNotification shim is that this
// package cross-compiles and unit-tests for darwin/arm64 in an ordinary Linux CI container
// (verified: GOOS=darwin GOARCH=arm64 CGO_ENABLED=0 go build succeeds), where a cgo darwin file
// would be compiled by nobody until a human builds on a Mac.

// Step names one of this app's pre-window boot-failure sites — the vocabulary Classify's table (D5)
// switches on. Adding a new Step without adding it to Classify's switch is a compile error: the
// switch has no default case (see classify.go).
