// (dataframe.go) and the per-session write queue (session.go).
//
// P58f M10 Phase 4: every kind has been served in-process since P58e M9.3 (ten of ten,
// checkpoint C2), so the Node engine child this Router used to forward non-native kinds to is
// gone — there is no more routing decision to make, only the native path. `NewRouterAllNodeServed`
// and the `*ViaChild` methods that existed solely for internal/connections' and internal/tree's
// tests died in the same commit as this collapse, since nothing left in this package's own tests
// exercised a "kind not native" case once every real kind always is.
