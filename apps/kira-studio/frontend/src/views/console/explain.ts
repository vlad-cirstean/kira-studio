// Per-dialect EXPLAIN, decided against real servers — never an ANALYZE/execute variant anywhere
// (EXPLAIN alone is ~800x cheaper than running the query, which is the entire premise auto-explain
// rests on). Keyed on ConnectionKind, not sqlDialectFor's SqlDialect union: MariaDB and MySQL
// share the 'mysql' dialect for quoting/grammar, but they return two genuinely different JSON
// schemas under the identical EXPLAIN FORMAT=JSON spelling, so the statement composer (here) and
// the plan parser (planParsers/) both need the finer-grained kind.
