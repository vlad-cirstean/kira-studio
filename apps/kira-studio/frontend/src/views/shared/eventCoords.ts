// P2 R2: a template handler written as a call expression closing over a v-for/scoped-slot loop
// variable (`@click="onCellClick(row, col)"`) can never be cached by Vue's compiler
// (compiler-core's hasScopeRef bails out on any v-for-scoped reference) — every row/cell gets a
// brand-new wrapper closure allocated on every render the component does for any reason, scroll
// included. The deleted DataGrid.vue found and fixed this first (P2 R1): bind a stable,
// module-scope `on*FromEvent` function instead, and have it recover its row/column position from
// a data-* attribute on the element the listener actually fired on. This is that recovery step,
// factored out so ConsoleResultGrid/StreamView/KeyValueView don't each carry their own copy.
//
// datasetKey is a dataset property name (camelCase — "row" for `data-row`, "rowIndex" for
// `data-row-index`). The walk up parentElement covers a listener bound to a child element (a cell)
// whose row index actually lives on an ancestor row element, the same shape the deleted
// DataGrid.vue's own onCellNavClickFromEvent needed for its nav button.
