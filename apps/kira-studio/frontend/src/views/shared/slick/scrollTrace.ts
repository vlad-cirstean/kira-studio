// P22 iter2 D2: a real-fling scroll trace, driven by a human on real hardware — see
// docs/v1.1/plans/P22-webview-scroll-performance-iter2-rendering.md §5 D2/§7.3. Every scroll
// measurement anywhere else in this repo (tests/ui/support/measure.ts included) drives `scrollTop`
// from the main thread, so the DOM's scroll offset and the main thread's knowledge of it are
// necessarily the same value — the condition that produces the user's real symptom (the compositor
// showing a position the main thread hasn't rendered yet, since WebKit's scrolling thread moves the
// composited layer independently of the main thread during a momentum scroll) can never occur in
// that harness. This module has no such limitation: it reads the *live* DOM during a *real*
// trackpad fling, from inside the packaged app's own DevTools (View → Open DevTools, a dev build —
// internal/shell/menutemplate.go). It is not a tests/ui/ instrument and is not gated in CI; it exists
// so a human can capture a number nobody in this repo's history has ever measured. Reachable at
// `window.__kiraScrollTrace` (wired here from DataGrid.vue's registerGrid/noteScrollEvent/noteNotify
// calls, not from columns.ts's offset observer — see DataGrid.vue's own onScroll comment for why).
//
// Usage (Web Inspector console, one hard two-finger flick between the two calls):
//   __kiraScrollTrace.start()
//   copy(JSON.stringify(__kiraScrollTrace.stop()))

   * `scrollTop +=` write driven from inside a rAF callback. The ordering is engine- and

   * fix (D1, `CHASE_QUIET_MS`) deliberately does not depend on which ordering a given frame has —
   * see kiraSlickGrid.ts's own `scheduleChase` comment. A real-Mac trace's `afterRaf` values are
