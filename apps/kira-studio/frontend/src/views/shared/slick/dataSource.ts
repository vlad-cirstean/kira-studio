// P22 spike, §6 D1 — the load-bearing decision the grid's SlickGrid migration lives or dies on:
// SlickGrid's own `CustomDataView` seam over the app's EXISTING frozen-page/decode-cache/staged-
// edit pipeline, never a materialised row array (that is `SlickDataView`'s job, declined — F9/§4).
// Nothing here is Vue-reactive; `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`'s "no Vue reactivity on row data" invariant
// holds by construction because `RowHandle` is a plain frozen object and `GridDataSourceState` is
// a plain object the host swaps by reassignment, never a `ref`/`reactive`.
//
// P30 §3 prerequisite: this is the generic *core* of what was one file
// (`views/grid/slick/dataSource.ts`) — display-position <-> page-row translation and the
// `CustomDataView` bridge itself, with no dependency on a data tab's pending-changes state. That
// dependency (`createDisplayValueExtractor`/`pendingRowClasses`, which read `pendingChanges.ts`)
// stayed behind in `views/grid/slick/dataSource.ts`, which re-exports everything here verbatim
// (SlickGridHost.vue's own import is unaffected) and adds those two grid-only functions.
// `views/console/ConsoleSlickGrid.vue` imports this module directly — SPEC §11 forbids it
// reaching into `views/grid/*` at all, and this core never needed to live there in the first
// place (F1's own finding: "no data-tab dependency").
