// P107 T2-17: split out of grid/slick/rowValues.ts — that file's other exports (displayCell,

// grid/pendingChanges), which views/console/** must not import (biome.json's noRestrictedImports,
// SPEC §11) — these two functions carry no such dependency, so only they move here.

 *  out — under an active "hide non-matching rows" filter that silently swept up hidden rows into
 *  copy/delete, never intended by the user. Ascending, matching `displayRows`' own contract; `r0`/
 *  `r1` may arrive in either order (a `SlickRange`-derived selection's anchor is always top-left,
