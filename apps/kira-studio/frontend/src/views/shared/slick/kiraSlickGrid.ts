 * rest — 3 rows/side (`minRowBuffer`) against this app's 560px (≈20 rows/side) — and not
 * velocity-scaled in motion; adopting it as-is would make the reported fast-scroll symptom worse,
 * not better. This reuses `rowRangeBounds` (the exact arithmetic the deleted `DataGrid.vue`'s own
 * row axis ran, C1's own refactor) rather than restating it — originally so both grids' at-rest
 * window was provably the same number during the migration, and still the reason this arithmetic
 * lives in its own shared function rather than inline here — `tests/unit/row-range-bounds.spec.ts`
 * covers that arithmetic; this file's own test (kira-slick-grid.spec.ts) covers the column-overscan
 * clamp and `countNewRows`, the batch-cap arithmetic below, neither of which live in columns.ts.
 *
 * Every SlickGrid method called below is public and documented in the published `.d.ts`:
 * `getVisibleRange`, `getDataLength`, `getOptions`, `getCanvasNode`. `vScrollDir` (a protected
 * field) is deliberately never read — direction comes from the host's own velocity sampler
 * (`velocity`, below), which already discards a discrete jump as "at rest"
 * (`MAX_PLAUSIBLE_ROW_VELOCITY_PX_PER_FRAME`, mirrored from the deleted DataGrid.vue's own onScroll), a case a
 * raw sign test on `vScrollDir` would not. **On a `slickgrid` version bump, re-check that
 * `render()` still calls `this.getRenderedRange()` and that its return shape is still
 * `{ top, bottom, leftPx, rightPx }`** — F4's own citation, `dist/esm/index.mjs`'s `render()`.
 *
 * P182 stage 1: `setScroller` reparents the scrolling `.slick-header` into the scroll viewport as a
 * sticky strip, so header and rows share one native scroller. `getBoundingClientRect` on that
 * viewport reports only the rows band, the box SlickGrid's `Utils.height`/`Utils.offset` reads
 * assume. Re-check on a `slickgrid` bump: `setScroller` still picks `_headerScrollContainer` and
 * `_viewportScrollContainerY`; viewport measurements still go through `Utils.height`/`Utils.offset`
 * (`grep -n "_viewportScrollContainer[XY]" slick.grid.ts`).

  /** P22 iter2-pacing D1 — the fix itself. A catch-up render is gated on scroll *quiescence*, not
   *  on a frame token ("did a render already run this frame?"): that plan's own §3 F2 found the
   *  intra-frame ordering of the scroll-driven render and a same-frame chase differs between
   *  engines and between input paths (opposite orderings from two different sandbox harnesses), so
   *  a fix that depends on which one ran first is correct in one environment and wrong in another.
   *  "Is a scroll still live?" is true in every frame that will carry a scroll-driven render,
   *  regardless of where in the frame that render actually sits — ordering-agnostic by
   *  construction. Termination: `chaseWanted` is recomputed by every render and clears once a
   *  render reaches `target`; `target` itself shrinks as the grid goes quiet (the host's own
   *  `velocity()` reports zero 150ms after the last scroll sample), so the deficit this loop is
   *  closing shrinks while it closes it — it cannot spin forever.
   *
   *  P22 iter2-onset D2 — the wall-clock half of that gate is **not sufficient on its own**, and
   *  this is a correction to the pacing pass, not a new requirement. `CHASE_QUIET_MS` is 24ms, but
   *  the very recording that pass was written from reports a **p50 frame duration of 32.1ms** on
   *  real hardware (docs/PERF.md §2.1c), and this sandbox's own wheel-fling harness measures p50 29
   *  / p95 58 / max 65ms. Whenever a frame outlasts the threshold, "24ms since the last scroll
   *  event" stops meaning "no scroll event is driving this frame" — the last event was simply in
   *  the *previous*, long, frame — and the gate silently opens on a frame that does carry a
   *  scroll-driven render. Measured: 7-9 doubled frames out of ~80 once a chase is actually wanted
   *  on every frame. It went unnoticed because at `a9dc570` the host's velocity sampler was one
   *  scroll event stale (P22 iter2-onset D1) and therefore reported *zero* on much of a fast fling,
   *  which collapses `target` to the base runway and means no chase is wanted at all — the gate was
   *  passing its own test by never being asked.
   *
   *  So the ms gate is joined by a **per-frame** one that cannot be outrun by a slow frame: a
   *  catch-up render requires that **no native `scroll` event arrived between the previous
   *  animation frame and this one**, read as a sequence number rather than a duration. That is the
   *  refinement the pacing plan's own §10 anticipated ("deriving the threshold from the observed
   *  rAF interval ... the obvious refinement"), and it keeps §3 F2's ordering-agnosticism intact —
   *  it still never asks whether the scroll render or the chase ran first within a frame, only
   *  whether a scroll event happened at all across the last one, which is true in every frame that
   *  will carry a scroll-driven render under either ordering. Cost: after a fling stops the chase
   *  now converges from the second quiet frame rather than the first. */

   *  `bindAncestorScrollEvents` (slick.grid.ts) does:

   *  `removeEventListener` only removes a listener registered with the *same* capture flag, so this
   *  capture-phase, document-level listener is never actually removed by any destroy path in the
   *  library. It survives the grid instance's own teardown, keeps firing on every scroll event
   *  anywhere in the document (it was never scoped to this grid's own container), and dereferences
   *  `this._viewport` — nulled by `destroyAllElements()` in the same `destroy(true)` call — on the

   *
   *  P22 postscript follow-up: this field must NOT carry a `= null` initializer. `SlickGrid`'s own
   *  constructor (`super()`) calls `initialize()` synchronously, which calls this class's own
   *  `bindAncestorScrollEvents()` override *from inside* `super()` — before `super()` has returned
   *  and therefore before this subclass's own field initializers run (standard JS: field
   *  initializers run in declaration order immediately after `super()` returns, per spec, same
   *  hazard `getRenderedRange`'s comment documents for `velocity`/`mountedColumnCount` below). A
   *  `= null` initializer here doesn't just leave the field transiently unset for one read — it
   *  unconditionally OVERWRITES the real handler `bindAncestorScrollEvents()` already wrote during
   *  `super()`, back to `null`, every single time. `destroy()` then finds `null` and never calls
   *  `removeEventListener`, leaking the capture-phase document listener (and everything its closure
   *  retains) for the life of the process. `declare` tells TS to skip emitting any field
   *  initialization for this property at all — construction-time assignment inside
   *  `bindAncestorScrollEvents()` is the only writer, and it survives `super()` returning.
