// P18 D9 (candidate lists for DocumentView.vue's filter/SORT boxes), promoted to views/shared/ by
// P22c D8 alongside a second job: sampling field names for the Mongo *console* too. Both jobs read
// the same idea — "field names sampled from documents actually loaded" — but through two different
// doors: the filter/sort box functions below take an explicit `fieldNames` list a caller already
// has (DocumentView.vue's own fieldNamesOnPage(tabId), a per-tab read); the console has no page of
// its own to read, so `registerMongoFieldSample`/`mongoFieldNamesFor` is a small, connection-scoped
// store DocumentView.vue pushes into whenever its own page changes, keyed by
// (connectionId, collectionPath) — never by tabId, so a console opened on the same collection from
// a different tab still sees it. Mandatory promotion: biome.json forbids views/console/**
// importing views/documents/** (the same rule P19 D7 promoted clipboardFormats.ts for), and the
// console needs exactly this.
//
// This is a SAMPLE, not a schema — stated plainly here and in P22c D8: it offers what has been
// seen, degrades to nothing when nothing has been loaded, and is never cached server-side (a Mongo
// collection has no declared field set to cache, adapters/mongo/adapter.go's own Columns: [] for
// the identical reason).
