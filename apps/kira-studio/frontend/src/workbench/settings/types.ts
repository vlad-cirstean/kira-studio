// app's own `workbench/SettingsDialog.vue` wrapper binds it per pane, `activeSection === '<Section>'`).

// `SettingsSections` — this dialog's own five sections of the full shared `Settings` (everything
// except `dbMcp`, which this dialog edits through its own instant-action controls,
// never through the draft) — is what SettingsShell.vue's own `T` generic is actually instantiated
// with at this app's `<SettingsShell>` call site (`workbench/SettingsDialog.vue`'s own `:current`/
// `:defaults`), so every pane's prop types must match that same narrowed shape, not the full
// `Settings` type, or Vue's generic prop inference rejects the binding.
