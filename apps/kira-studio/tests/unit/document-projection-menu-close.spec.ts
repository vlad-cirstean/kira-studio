// P108 Part 11 F6: ProjectionMenu.vue's own close-time decision — an untouched close silently
// cleared an active projection whenever the projected page's own (already-narrowed) field set
// happened to match it exactly, and "None" wrote `[]` rather than null even though Mongo's own
// empty-projection behaviour returns every field regardless. nextDocumentProjectionOnClose is the
// pure decision the fix routes through, tested at its own boundary — mirrors grid/menu.ts's own
// nextProjectionFromSelectedColumns test shape (grid-menu-projection-empty-guard.spec.ts).
