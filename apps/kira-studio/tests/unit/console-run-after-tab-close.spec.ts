// P12 round 2 finding #3: run() captured its runtime record (`rt`) locally and only re-checked
// `rt.opId`/`rt.status` after the await — never whether the tab itself still existed. Closing a
// tab mid-run deletes `runtime[tabId]` (state/tabRuntime.ts's cleanup), but `rt` is still a live
// reference to that now-detached object, so the continuation ran anyway: dropResults() was a
// no-op (the runtime entry was already gone) and setPage() wrote the result page into
// resultPages.ts's module-level store under a key nothing can ever reach again (`nextSeq` never
// repeats) — a permanent leak. This drives run() end to end, triggering the exact runtime-cleanup
// hook `state/tabs.ts`'s real `closeTab` fires (`cleanupTabRuntime`, `state/tabRuntime.ts`) while
// the query is still in flight, and asserts nothing gets written once it resolves. Deliberately
// bypasses `closeTab` itself, which also debounces a real `control.tabsSave` IPC call through
// `bridge/port.ts`'s module-scope singleton — `bridge-port.spec.ts` drives that same singleton
// directly against its own fake socket, so triggering a real send from here would race it.
