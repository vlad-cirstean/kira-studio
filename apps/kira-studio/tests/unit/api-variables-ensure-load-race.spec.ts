// P108 F2: ensureVariablesLoaded had no dedupe or sequencing. `if (!ownerId || listCache[key])
// return; listCache[key] = await control.variablesList(...)` let two concurrent callers each fire
// their own request, and a slow first reply landing after a later loadVariableSetRows (a post-edit
// refresh) overwrote the just-written fresh rows with the pre-edit list — every subsequent send for
// that scope then substituted stale plain values until the next edit.
//
// P112: `listCache` and its hand-rolled dedupe are gone. loadVariableRows (apiQueries.ts) is
// `queryClient.query()`, which dedupes concurrent callers for the same key on its own — the first
// half of F2 needs no dedicated fix any more, just a pin that the dedupe still holds. The second
// half — a stale in-flight reply landing after a fresher write must not clobber it — is
// refreshApiQuery's own documented race (apiQueries.ts, above its definition): an observer-less
// in-flight `queryClient.query` caller (e.g. send()) must not have its invalidation cleared by that
// in-flight fetch resolving afterward with pre-change data.
