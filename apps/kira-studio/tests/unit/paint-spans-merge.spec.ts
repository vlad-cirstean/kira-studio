// P60a §5/§9.2: mergeHighlightRanges is the one pure boundary-merge function this migration adds a
// dedicated unit test for — two sorted interval lists (syntax-colour "base" runs, which tile
// [0, textLength) with no gaps, and possibly-overlapping {{variable}}/find-match "highlight"
// ranges), including the degenerate inputs (zero-width, out-of-range) real callers can hand it a
// keystroke stale. parseColorizedLine's own HTML-shape parsing is exercised alongside it since both
// live in editor/paintSpans.ts and both are pure, DOM-free functions.
