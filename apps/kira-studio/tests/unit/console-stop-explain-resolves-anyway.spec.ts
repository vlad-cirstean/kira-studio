// P12 round 2 finding #5: even with finding #4's identity-guarded explainOpId clear, nothing
// recorded that Stop was pressed if the in-flight EXPLAIN `data.execute` call happened to resolve
// normally before the cancel signal reached it (rather than rejecting with E_CANCELLED) — rt.status
// was still 'running', rt.opId was still this run's, so run()'s post-await guard passed and the
// real (possibly expensive) query fired anyway despite the Stop press. This drives run()/stop() end
// to end (same style as console-stop-auto-explain.spec.ts) with exactly that ordering: Stop is
// pressed while the EXPLAIN batch is in flight, and *then* the batch resolves successfully instead
// of rejecting — the real query must still never be issued.
