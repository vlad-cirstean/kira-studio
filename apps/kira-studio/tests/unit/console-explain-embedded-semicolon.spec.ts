// P108 Part 11 F2: isExplainable's raw-semicolon guard, the TS twin of the Go test in
// statements_test.go. A leading SELECT/WITH is not enough — the splitter that decided this was
// "one statement" can itself be fooled (F4: Postgres E'...' strings, `$` inside an identifier), and
// wrapping a merged statement in EXPLAIN would still execute whatever follows the `;` (Postgres's
// simple protocol runs every command in one Query message).
