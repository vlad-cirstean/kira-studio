// P12 round 2 finding #4: run()'s two `rt.explainOpId = null` clears (the cancellation catch and
// the post-await settle path) were bare, unlike every other op-id field in this file — so an
// overlapping second run's own explainOpId, stamped *after* the first run started, could be wiped
// out when the first run's own EXPLAIN batch settles. `runStatement`/`runAll` have no `running`
// guard at the command-dispatch layer (only the toolbar buttons do), and run() itself never guarded
// re-entrancy, so two runs against the same tab can genuinely overlap. This drives run() end to end
// (same style as console-stop-auto-explain.spec.ts) to prove: run A's EXPLAIN batch settling must
// not discard run B's explainOpId, so Stop pressed during B's batch still has something to cancel.
