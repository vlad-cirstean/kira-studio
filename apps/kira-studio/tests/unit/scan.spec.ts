// P44 F45: views/shared/page/scan.ts's runChunkedScan is a two-phase, frame-driven scheduler
// (P42 D37's priority window, then an ascending main pass) whose every interesting behaviour is
// defined *by animation-frame boundary* — three separate P43 findings (F30, F36, F36a, F40) reason
// about exactly this scheduling and none of them got a deterministic assertion, because a
// Playwright test cannot pause between two frames: it can only wait for a settled end state, by
// which point the priority tick, the chunk boundary and the cancel point have all already happened.
// P43 iteration 3's own plan said as much twice about the same surface (its commit 6/commit 4 rows:
// the SQLite seed "completes in one frame, so there is no in-flight scan to navigate"; the stale-
// failure half "has no DOM assertion the suite can make deterministically"). A fake
// requestAnimationFrame that hands frames out one at a time turns every one of these into an
// ordinary assertion. scan.ts imports nothing, so — unlike every other spec here — no window stub
// is needed, only the global requestAnimationFrame it calls by name.
