// P12 round 1 finding #5: Stop was a no-op while auto-explain's pre-run EXPLAIN batch was in
// flight — rt.opId held the *real* run's future id, which the backend had never registered, so
// stopOp's control.opsCancel(rt.opId) call landed on nothing. The EXPLAIN batch then always ran to
// completion and the real (possibly expensive) query fired regardless of the Stop press. This
// drives run()/stop() end to end (same style as console-result-cap.spec.ts) to prove: pressing
// Stop while the EXPLAIN batch is in flight cancels *that* op, and the real query is never issued
// at all — the one ordering guarantee no non-Docker Playwright test can force deterministically.
