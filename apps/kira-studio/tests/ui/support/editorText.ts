// P60a §9.1/OQ-3: Monaco virtualises lines — `.view-lines` only ever contains the currently
// rendered subset of a large document, unlike CodeMirror's `.cm-content` (whose `innerText` was
// the whole document) before it. `MonacoHost.vue` exposes its model's full text through a
// `__KIRA_DEBUG_HOOKS__`-gated `data-kira-editor-text` attribute on its own root element — the
// same convention `vite.config.ts`'s `__KIRA_DEBUG_HOOKS__` define and `main.ts`'s `window.__kira*`
// hooks already use, rather than a `page.evaluate` over a `window.monaco` global that isn't
// otherwise exposed. This is the one place every UI spec reads a Monaco host's full document from.

/** `container` is any Locator either wrapping exactly one `MonacoHost` mount (a pane, a dialog
 *  body, a row whose own `data-testid` sits on an ancestor — `.monaco-host` is then a descendant)
 *  or the mount's own root directly (a site that passes its `data-testid` straight onto
 *  `<MonacoHost>`, which now lands on that root itself via `$attrs` fallthrough — `container` IS
 *  `.monaco-host` there, not its parent). `descendant-or-self` covers both without the caller
 *  needing to know which shape its own testid produced. Finds that host's own root and reads its
 *  full text; empty string if the attribute is absent (host still pending its first paint, or not
 *  a MonacoHost at all). */
