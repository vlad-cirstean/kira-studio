// P28 D19: looksLikeCurlCommand earns a dedicated test where the rest of the batch does not. It is
// a recogniser with several interacting rules (prompt prefixes, quoting, a path-qualified command
// name, a whole-token match, a required argument) guarding a destructive action: a false positive
// silently replaces the user's entire request with whatever parseCurl makes of text that was never
// a curl command. parseCurl itself is already covered by http-curl.spec.ts; the guard was not.
