// P4 D15: two views of the same request exist by construction — http_items.request_json (the
// saved one) and tabs.state_json (the tab's, autosaved on the existing 1 s debounce). P4 does not
// merge them, deliberately:
//
//   - Autosaving edits straight into the collection row was considered — it is what tabs, layout
//     and settings all do. Declined: it makes "open a saved request and try something"
//     destructive, which is the single most common thing anyone does with a saved request, and it
//     leaves nowhere to stand for a Revert.
//   - A stored dirty flag was also declined. Dirtiness is toSavedRequest(state) compared against
//     the saved document — a pure function of two things already in memory, so there is no flag to
//     set, clear, migrate or get wrong.
//
// Pure and DOM-free, in the spirit of url.ts.
