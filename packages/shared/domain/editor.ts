// P12 F14/D5: EditorLanguageId lifted out of frontend/src/editor/languages.ts, whose module body
// imports four CodeMirror packages — a plain type-only import erases at build time
// (verbatimModuleSyntax), so there was no runtime coupling, but a *package* still cannot
// type-check against a file it cannot resolve (packages/api-core needs this type for
// views/httprequest/body.ts, which is not otherwise CodeMirror-coupled at all). Six-member union,
// re-exported from editor/languages.ts so nothing else in the app has to change its import.
export type EditorLanguageId = 'json' | 'xml' | 'sql' | 'mongo' | 'redis' | 'plain';
