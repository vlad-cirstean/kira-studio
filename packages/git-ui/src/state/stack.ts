 * whole restack flow is these three calls plus the reactive `restacking`/`progress` pair below.

 * class calls `PrState.ensureSnapshot` with the union of every branch name in the result — no new
 * RPC, no new cache, no new rate-limit exposure beyond the snapshot G24 already fetches lazily.
 * `pr` is optional (mirroring `SearchState`'s own constructor) so a test — or a future host with no
 * GitHub surface at all — can construct this class without one.
