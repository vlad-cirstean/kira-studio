 *   by `GEOMETRY.overdraw` past the row's bottom only; the top is the node itself, not a row
 *   boundary, so it gets none.
 * - `row === toRow` (and `toRow` is resolved): the parent's own row. From the top of this row
 *   down to the node's centre, `runLane -> toLane` (a bend when a convergence put the node in
 *   another lane) — overdrawn past the top only, for the same reason in reverse.
 * - Otherwise (a pass-through row, or an edge whose `toRow` is still `UNRESOLVED_ROW` — "runs to
 *   the bottom of its row and stops", which for a query bounded to `[0, rowCount)` it already
 *   does): a full-height run in `runLane`, overdrawn at both ends — two adjacent rows' runs must
 *   meet across a fractional `devicePixelRatio` without a hairline seam (§5.3's fifth decision).
