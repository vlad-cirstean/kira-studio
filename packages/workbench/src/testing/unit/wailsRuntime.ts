// The one and only mock.module registration for '/wails/runtime.js' across the whole tests/unit
// run — P57's counterpart to window.ts's window.kira stub, and for the same reason: Bun's module
// registry is shared across every spec file in a single run, so two different mock.module calls
// for the same specifier race for whichever wins (window.ts's own comment documents the
// window.kira version of this, found the hard way in P43 iteration 3). Every spec whose import
// chain reaches bridge/port.ts or bridge/control.ts — directly, or via data.ts /
// workbench/state/engine.ts — needs this to resolve, not only specs that test the transport
// itself: control.ts's own top-level imports pull in every generated service binding (each of
// which imports `Call` from this same specifier) the moment control.ts is loaded at all.
//
// This is a mock.module call, not a tsconfig "paths" redirect, deliberately: a "paths" entry for
// this exact specifier — tried first — makes Bun's own module resolver hijack it before
// mock.module ever gets a chance, in every file that transitively reaches it, not only the one
// declaring the mapping (confirmed by experiment: pointing "paths" at this very file, a real and
// otherwise-loadable module, still produced "Cannot find module" from bridge/port.ts). Since
// TypeScript also forbids an ambient `declare module` for a path-like specifier ("Ambient module
// declaration cannot specify relative module name"), so port.ts's and control.ts's own imports
// each carry a suppression directive instead — see their comments.
//
// Most specs never touch any of this: they override `data`'s or `control`'s own methods above
// the transport (view-state.spec.ts's `(data as any).read = ...`), so `Call`/`Events` only need
// to exist as real named exports, never actually get invoked, and don't need to do anything
// useful. bridge-port.spec.ts is the one spec that drives the Stream transport directly.
//
// port.ts's `const socket = Stream('engine')` runs once, ever, for the whole test process (Bun's
// module registry caches port.ts itself across every spec file that imports it, whichever comes
// first in bun test's own file-discovery order — not necessarily, and empirically not always,
// alphabetical or CLI-argument order). An earlier design here tried to *pre-register* the fake
// socket bridge-port.spec.ts wanted (`setSocketFactory` before its own dynamic import), betting
// that its dynamic `import('.../bridge/port')` would always be the first thing in the whole run to
// evaluate port.ts's module body. That bet is exactly the race: any other spec whose import chain
// reaches port.ts first (bridge/data.ts, workbench/state/engine.ts) locks in a *different* fake
// socket — created by whatever factory was installed at that earlier moment — and
// bridge-port.spec.ts's later `setSocketFactory` call is too late to matter, since port.ts's
// module-scope `Stream('engine')` never runs a second time. The test then drives a socket object
// port.ts never sees, so every response/open/close it injects is silently inert (a request that
// never gets `send()`'d "isn't sent" only because nothing reaches the real transport at all, and
// `ready` times out instead of resolving) — which reads as 5 s test timeouts and JSON-parsing
// garbage a request or two later, depending on exactly which tests happened to still have pending
// promises when the mismatch set in. `sigma-count-refresh.spec.ts`'s filename-note comment records
// one attempt to dodge this by picking a spec name that empirically sorted the "right" way — a
// naming hack, not a fix, and it stopped working the moment another spec's name (or bun's own
// discovery order) shifted again.
//
// The actual fix: stop betting on load order entirely. `Stream(name)` memoizes one socket per
// name the first time it's asked for that name, by *whichever* caller asks first — a later call
// for the same name is a no-op that just returns the same instance, by design, since the
// module-scope call it would need to affect has already happened. `getStream(name)` (below) is
// that same lookup, exposed so a spec can ask for the real transport's socket *after* importing
// port.ts — for whatever socket port.ts actually ended up holding, rather than trying to inject
// one in advance and hoping to win a race it has no way to guarantee winning.
