// Built by `bun run build:studio`/`build:space` (each app's own vite.config.ts → frontend/dist), the exact
// bytes the real Wails bundle embeds (P52 main.go's `//go:embed all:frontend/dist`) — this tier
// serves the same static output a packaged app does, just over plain HTTP instead of Wails' own
// AssetServer. P103 Part 4 (closing audit, §10): this file was a per-app duplicate through Parts
// 1-3, code-identical bar its own doc comment — never named in either part's own scope. Its one
// real per-app value, the built `dist` directory, was computed from `__dirname` rather than passed
// in, so hoisting it unchanged would have resolved against `packages/workbench`'s own location
// instead of either app's. Fixed by taking `distDir` as a parameter; each app's own `fixtures.ts`
// resolves its own `frontend/dist` from its own `__dirname` and passes it in.
