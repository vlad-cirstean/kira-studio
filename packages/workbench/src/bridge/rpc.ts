// bridge/rpc.ts — the four bound-call primitives every service surface (Studio's own, in
// bridge/index.ts, and the Api module's, in apiControl.ts) shares. Split out of what used to be
// control.ts (round-1 review finding 19): apiControl.ts imported these from control.ts, which
// itself imported and composed apiControl.ts back in — a cycle that worked today only because
// every use sat inside a method body rather than at module-body top level, and that structurally
// inverted the intended dependency direction (the Api half should be removable without the
// Studio half caring, not the other way around). Neither half imports the other any more: both
// depend only on this file, which depends on neither.

// See bridge/port.ts's identical import for why this needs the directive below rather than the
// require-an-error kind (P57 M1/M2 finding: a tsconfig "paths" entry for this exact specifier
// breaks Bun's mock.module interception).
// biome-ignore lint/suspicious/noTsIgnore: an "unused directive" kind fails where this resolves fine (see comment above)

// here, so every consumer keeps reading `err.message` for display and `err.code` for branching.
// P10 D15: `details` — ipcerr.Error's own optional `json.RawMessage` field — is carried through
// the same way, parsed once here rather than pushed onto every consumer; `undefined` for every
// existing producer, which leaves the field unset (`omitempty`).

// keeps its own return type exactly as it was pre-P57 (plain arrays, never null) rather than
// pushing that generator conservatism onto every caller.
//
// The generated bindings also type every Go enum-like field (ConnectionSummary.kind,
// ConnectionState.status, SecretStorageStatus.backend, TreeVisibility's hiddenKinds, SavedQuery's
// kind/body, OpRecord.kind, TabRecord.kind, TreeNode.kind, ObjectMeta/ObjectDefinition.kind…) as
// plain `string`, since Go's own enum-like types don't carry a literal-union guarantee across the
// wire the way a Zod schema does. The Go value is always one of the valid members — the same
// trust boundary window.kira's Electron IPC handlers implicitly had — so `trust` is a deliberate,
// documented widen-then-narrow, not a silent bypass of a real check.
