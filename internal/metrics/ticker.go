// HelperNeedles is AppProcessSet's own second needle set — the native-webview helper processes
// macOS itself attributes to one of a running app's own executables (P58f: no vendored Node child
// needle any more — every adapter is served in-process by the app's own binary). Shared by every
// app's own metrics ticker; the anchor needle (the app's own executable name) is not shared — see
// NewAppTicker.

// RescanEvery is how many Interval ticks pass between CachedPIDs' full process-table resolves.
//
// One, i.e. every tick. P2 R1 originally set this to 12 (60s) to avoid "walking every process on
// the machine every single tick for the life of the app", and traded a rescan interval's worth of
// staleness for it. That trade was a bad one in both directions, and the staleness was not
// cosmetic:
//
//   - CachedPIDs.revalidate only ever *drops* pids — it cannot add one. So a process that appears
//     after a resolve is invisible until the next resolve, up to RescanEvery ticks later.
//   - Ticker.run's own priming sample forces the first resolve at startup, which on macOS is
//     before WKWebView has spawned com.apple.WebKit.{WebContent,Networking,GPU} at all. The
//     status bar therefore reported the Go process alone — one process, ~38 MB, no webview — for
//     the first minute of every run, which is exactly the window someone launching the app looks
//     at. The same hole reopens whenever a WebContent process is replaced.
//
// The cost it was buying is not real: a full AppProcessSet resolve over a 472-process machine
// measures 1.9 ms, against an Interval of 5 s — a 0.04% duty cycle. Rescanning every tick makes
// the reading correct within one Interval in every case, at a cost that does not register.

// Emitting to the renderer (`app.Event.Emit`) and stopping it on quit are both P56.
