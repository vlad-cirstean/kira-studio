// OpenWindow opens one workbench from an already-persisted record and registers it — the one path

// listener implements D5: delete the row only if another window remains open, so closing the last
// window leaves it behind for the next Dock click or relaunch to restore.
//
// primaryWorkArea (Options' first-launch size clamp, P22 D6(a)) is resolved fresh here, on every
// call, rather than captured once before app.Run() — round-2 review finding 4: GetPrimary() is
// backed by a cache macOS only starts populating once its native run loop's
// ApplicationDidFinishLaunching fires (application_darwin.go's own `run()`), which happens only
// after C.run() — i.e. strictly after app.Run() is called, never before. A value captured before
// Run() is therefore permanently nil for every window opened this way, including "New Window" and
// Dock-reopen, even though those happen well after Run() and the cache is long since populated by
// the time they run. Resolving it per call fixes that for them. It can NOT fix the very first
// window(s) opened at startup (each app's own main.go calls this before app.Run()): those are
// still created before app.Run() ever runs, so no ordering of this lookup changes their
// primaryWorkArea, which stays nil — first real launch keeps the unclamped 1280×800 default until
// the window is resized once (DefaultBounds' own doc comment). Deferring startup window creation
// until after ApplicationDidFinishLaunching would close that gap but is a materially larger
// structural change, out of scope here.
