// Package appevent is the Go->renderer push seam (P56 D1/D4) and the small set of IPC channel
// strings both apps' menu/quit/close-flush handshakes emit on, shared verbatim (P103 Part 3):

// identical three-method interfaces, and bridge.Events' Signal/SignalTo/Broadcast/NewEvents core
// was byte-identical in both apps too. Each app's own internal/bridge/events.go still owns its
// own channel constants and its own Attach — this package is only the shared core they embed.

// Event.Emit/DispatchWailsEvent; each app's bridge.Events is its one real consumer, so no bridge
// file has to import Wails. EmitTo delivers to exactly one window by key — the mechanism the
// per-window close-flush handshake builds on. EmitFocused delivers to whichever window is
// currently key/focused, the successor to Electron's own sendToFocusedWindow.
