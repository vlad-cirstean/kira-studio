// Coalescer batches pushed items and flushes the accumulated batch on whichever comes first: an
// accumulated size (sizeOf-weighted) threshold, an interval timer, or Finish — the shape
// bridge/terminal.go's terminalCoalescer, bridge/grpc.go's grpcCoalescer and
// bridge/codeworkspace.go's searchCoalescer each restated by hand for their own payload type
// (P107 T2-7). sizeOf lets one accumulator serve all three: a message counts as 1 (grpcCoalescer),
// a file-match group counts by its own match count (searchCoalescer), a terminal chunk counts by
// its byte length (terminalCoalescer) — each push is still exactly one item, one call.
//
// F is whatever "final" extra payload only the terminal flush carries (an exit code, a call
// result, search stats) — threaded through Finish's own parameter rather than a field a flush
// closure reads back later, so a final payload is race-free with no lock of its own beyond this
// type's.
