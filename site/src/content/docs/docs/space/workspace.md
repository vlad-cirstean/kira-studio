## Repositories

Import a git repository. It opens as its own workspace with its own tab set.

## File tree and viewer

The tree lists every tracked file and every untracked file that is not ignored. A file opens read-only in Monaco.

The tree refreshes when the workspace opens and on **Refresh**. It does not update live.

## Diffs

A diff tab compares the worktree with `HEAD` in Monaco's diff editor.

## Search

- In a file: Monaco's find widget.
- In the repository: a Go search that streams results. It starts no `ripgrep` process.

## Blame

Inline blame annotates each line. Toggle it in `Settings > Appearance`.

The status bar always shows the cursor line's author, relative date and commit summary. Click it to reveal the commit in the graph.

A file tab pinned to a historical revision shows no blame. Blame reflects only the working tree.

## Markdown

A toggle beside the raw view shows rendered Markdown, per tab.
