Docker mode manages the local engine or a saved context.

## What you can do

- List containers, images, volumes and networks.
- Start, stop and restart containers.
- Edit a container's limits, restart policy, name and networks in place. Other changes recreate it.
- Read live container logs.
- Watch live container stats.
- Open an exec terminal into a running container.

## Remote engines

A remote `tcp://` engine without TLS works. The UI flags it as insecure.
