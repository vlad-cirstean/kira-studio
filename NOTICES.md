# Third-Party Notices

This file lists third-party icon assets bundled with Kira Studio's UI, and any dependency whose
license terms call for a notice beyond the standard MIT/BSD/Apache-2.0 attribution `go.mod`/
`package.json` already carry.

## simple-icons

Kira Studio imports database/service engine marks (Postgres, MariaDB, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB,
Redis, Apache Kafka, ClickHouse) from the [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/) icon
set (`simple-icons` on npm), via `import { siX } from 'simple-icons'` and each icon's `path` and
`hex` fields.

Simple Icons' own code and icon data are dedicated to the public domain under CC0 1.0 Universal:

```
Creative Commons Legal Code

CC0 1.0 Universal
```

The full legal text is reproduced in `node_modules/simple-icons/LICENSE.md` and at
<https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode>; no attribution is legally required
under CC0, though it is credited here regardless.

One icon carries an additional, more specific license: Apache Kafka's mark is noted by Simple
Icons as licensed under Apache-2.0 (<https://spdx.org/licenses/Apache-2.0>).

The individual marks reproduced through Simple Icons (Postgres, MariaDB, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB,
Redis, Apache Kafka, ClickHouse) remain trademarks of their respective owners. They are
used here solely to identify the corresponding database/service engine in the connection UI, not
to imply endorsement by, or affiliation with, those trademark holders.

Amazon SQS and Amazon S3 are not available in Simple Icons (Amazon does not publish per-service
icon marks under a redistributable license there); their icons in Kira Studio are original,
hand-drawn glyphs, not reproductions of Amazon's trademarks.

## seti-icons / seti-ui

Kira Space's file tree (`FileTree.vue`) renders per-language file icons from
[`seti-icons`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/seti-icons) (npm), via
`import { themeIcons } from 'seti-icons'`. `seti-icons` repackages the icon set and colour palette
from [jesseweed/seti-ui](https://github.com/jesseweed/seti-ui) — the same upstream VS Code's own
built-in Seti theme (`vs-seti`) derives from — as plain, tracked JSON/JS data, with no vendored
binary font.

Both `seti-icons` and `seti-ui` are licensed under the MIT License:

```

Copyright for `seti-icons` belongs to Elvis Wolcott; copyright for the underlying `seti-ui` icon
set and palette belongs to the Seti UI contributors (Jesse Weed and contributors).

## monaco-editor

Kira Studio's native code-viewing workspace (C5, `views/repo/`) renders opened repository files
read-only with [`monaco-editor`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/monaco-editor) (npm, pinned
0.56.0) — the editor component that also powers Visual Studio Code, reached only through
`views/repo/monacoEntry.ts`'s own dynamic `import()` boundary (studio/api sessions never download
this chunk). Its bundled icon font, `codicon.ttf` (pulled in transitively by
`monaco-editor/features/register.all.js`'s own `codicon.css`), ships and is credited here the same
way `seti-icons` is above — a second, independent copy of the codicon glyphs from this app's own
`@vscode/codicons` dependency (CodiconIcon.vue), since Monaco's internal widgets (the find toolbar,
inline suggestions) reference their own bundled copy rather than this app's.

`monaco-editor` is licensed under the MIT License:

## fuzzysort

Kira Studio's quick open (C9, ⌘P) ranks repository files by fuzzy subsequence match with
[`fuzzysort`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fuzzysort) (npm, pinned 4.0.2), a direct dependency
statically imported (`repo/state/quickOpen.ts`) — zero transitive dependencies of its own.

`fuzzysort` is licensed under the MIT License:

## @xterm/xterm

Kira Studio's embedded terminal (P83, `views/repo/`) renders a worktree's own shell with
[`@xterm/xterm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xterm/xterm) (npm, pinned 6.0.0) plus its
`@xterm/addon-fit` companion (pinned 0.11.0) — the terminal emulator that also powers Visual
Studio Code's integrated terminal, reached only through `views/repo/terminalRenderer.ts`'s own
dynamic `import()` boundary (`monaco-editor`'s own precedent, above: studio/api sessions never
download this chunk).

`@xterm/xterm` and `@xterm/addon-fit` are licensed under the MIT License:

## ONNX Runtime and the arctic-embed-s model

Kira Space's memory search (P210) bundles the [ONNX Runtime](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime)
1.29.1 shared library (MIT) in `Contents/Frameworks`, with its `LICENSE` and `ThirdPartyNotices.txt`
copied to `Contents/Resources` as `onnxruntime-LICENSE.txt` and `onnxruntime-ThirdPartyNotices.txt`.
It loads it through `github.com/yalue/onnxruntime_go` (MIT) and tokenizes with
`github.com/gomlx/go-huggingface` (Apache-2.0). The user downloads the embedding model,
[Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-s](https://huggingface.co/Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-s)
(Apache-2.0), on request; it is not bundled.
