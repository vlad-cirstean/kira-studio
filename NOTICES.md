# Third-Party Notices

This file lists third-party icon assets bundled with Kira Studio's UI, and any dependency whose
license terms call for a notice beyond the standard MIT/BSD/Apache-2.0 attribution `go.mod`/
`package.json` already carry.

## simple-icons

Kira Studio imports database/service engine marks (Postgres, MariaDB, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB,
Redis, Apache Kafka, ClickHouse) from the [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/) icon
set (`simple-icons` on npm), via `import { siX } from 'simple-icons'` and each icon's `path` and
`hex` fields.

Simple Icons' own code and icon data are dedicated to the public domain under CC0 1.0 Universal:

```
Creative Commons Legal Code

CC0 1.0 Universal
```

The full legal text is reproduced in `node_modules/simple-icons/LICENSE.md` and at
<https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode>; no attribution is legally required
under CC0, though it is credited here regardless.

One icon carries an additional, more specific license: Apache Kafka's mark is noted by Simple
Icons as licensed under Apache-2.0 (<https://spdx.org/licenses/Apache-2.0>).

The individual marks reproduced through Simple Icons (Postgres, MariaDB, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB,
Redis, Apache Kafka, ClickHouse) remain trademarks of their respective owners. They are
used here solely to identify the corresponding database/service engine in the connection UI, not
to imply endorsement by, or affiliation with, those trademark holders.

Amazon SQS and Amazon S3 are not available in Simple Icons (Amazon does not publish per-service
icon marks under a redistributable license there); their icons in Kira Studio are original,
hand-drawn glyphs, not reproductions of Amazon's trademarks.

## gokeepasslib
