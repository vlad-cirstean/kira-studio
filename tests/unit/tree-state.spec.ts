// P2 R1: two related fixes to project/state/tree.ts.
//
// 1. treeState used to be one deep reactive() wrapping `children` — a Record<rowKey, TreeNode[]>
//    that's the tree's own node cache. A big expanded schema or a Redis namespace can cache
//    thousands of TreeNode objects (plus their badges arrays) there; deep reactive() wrapped every
//    one of them in a Proxy for no reason, since the only two writers (loadChildren,
//    dropConnectionState) always replace or delete a whole rowKey entry, never mutate a cached
//    node's own field. `children` is now its own nested shallowReactive — test 1 confirms that
//    directly, test 2 confirms the "whole entry replace/delete" contract that actually matters is
//    still tracked. Test 3 guards the part that's easy to break doing this: `expanded`/`loading`
//    are Sets mutated in place (.add()/.delete()), which only stay tracked under *deep* reactivity —
//    so treeState itself must stay a real reactive(), only `children` opts out.
//
// 2. searchResult's buildRows/buildNodeRow recurse over every cached node for every connection on
//    every recompute; SearchBox.vue/ProjectPanel.vue used to write straight into treeState.search
//    on every keystroke with nothing debouncing the recompute this triggers. Test 4 confirms a
//    burst of synchronous writes (a fast typist) produces exactly one settled update, not one per
//    character.
