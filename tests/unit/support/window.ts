// module-scope dependency is now `Events`/`JSONStream` from '/wails/runtime.js', and state/tabs.ts's
// module-scope `control.onFlushBeforeClose(...)` call goes through that same rewritten control.ts.
// `window` itself is kept as a bare `addEventListener` stub only because some transitively-imported
// module may still probe for a DOM global at load time; no spec that imports this module asserts
// anything that reads it.

// that specifier to resolve under Bun. The './wailsRuntime' import above registers the one shared
// mock.module for it; see its own comment for why it has to be the only registration in the whole
// run.
